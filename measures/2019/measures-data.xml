    <title>Population empanelment</title>
    <description>Empanel (assign responsibility for) the total population, linking each patient to a MIPS eligible clinician or group or care team.Empanelment is a series of processes that assign each active patient to a MIPS eligible clinician or group and/or care team, confirm assignment with patients and clinicians, and use the resultant patient panels as a foundation for individual patient and population health management.Empanelment identifies the patients and population for whom the MIPS eligible clinician or group and/or care team is responsible and is the foundation for the relationship continuity between patient and MIPS eligible clinician or group /care team that is at the heart of comprehensive primary care. Effective empanelment requires identification of the "active population" of the practice: those patients who identify and use your practice as a source for primary care. There are many ways to define "active patients" operationally, but generally, the definition of "active patients" includes patients who have sought care within the last 24 to 36 months, allowing inclusion of younger patients who have minimal acute or preventive health care.</description>

    <title>Engage Patients and Families to Guide Improvement in the System of Care</title>
    <description>Engage patients and families to guide improvement in the system of care by leveraging digital tools for ongoing guidance and assessments outside the encounter, including the collection and use of patient data for return-to-work and patient quality of life improvement.  Platforms and devices that collect patient-generated health data (PGHD) must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient, including patient reported outcomes (PROs). Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way).  Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient's status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.</description>

    <description>The Intracranial Hemorrhage or Cerebral Infarction cost measure is meant to apply to clinicians who manage the inpatient care of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for an intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral infarction during the performance period. This cost measure excludes those patients whose initial hospitalization was due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage or a cerebral infarction which received thrombolytic therapy. The measure evaluates a clinician’s risk-adjusted cost for the episode group by averaging it across all episodes attributed to the clinician. The cost of each episode is the sum of the cost to Medicare for services performed by the attributed clinician and other health care providers over the length of the episode, or “episode window.” The cost measure is calculated by determining the risk-adjusted episode cost,  averaged across all of a clinician’s episodes during the performance period.</description>

    <title>ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)</title>
    <description>The STEMI with PCI cost measure is meant to apply to clinicians who manage the inpatient care of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized during the performance period for a STEMI requiring PCI. This acute medical condition captures the care of those patients who present with STEMI indicating complete blockage of a coronary artery who emergently receive PCI as treatment. The measure evaluates a clinician’s risk-adjusted cost for the episode group by averaging it across all episodes attributed to the clinician. The cost of each episode is the sum of the cost to Medicare for services performed by the attributed clinician and other health care providers over the length of the episode, or “episode window.” The cost measure is calculated by determining the risk-adjusted episode cost,  averaged across all of a clinician’s episodes during the performance period.</description>

    <title>Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB)</title>
    <description>The Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB) measure evaluates solo practitioners and groups on their spending efficiency and is risk-adjusted to account for patients' risk profiles. Solo practitioners and groups are identified by their National Provider Identification (NPI) and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) combination. Specifically, the MSPB measure assesses the average spend for Medicare services performed by providers/groups per episode of care. Each episode comprises the period immediately prior to, during, and following a patient's hospital stay.</description>
