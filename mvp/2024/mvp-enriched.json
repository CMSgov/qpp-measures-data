Examples include recognition for achieving success in measure reporting and/or a high level of effort directed to quality improvement and practice standardization; or\n• Participation in the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) Multi-Specialty Portfolio Program.",

        "description": "Engage patients and families to guide improvement in the system of care by leveraging digital tools for ongoing guidance and assessments outside the encounter, including the collection and use of patient data for return-to-work and patient quality of life improvement. Platforms and devices that collect patient-generated health data (PGHD) must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient, including patient reported outcomes (PROs). Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way). Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient’s status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

The review should consider how structural inequities, such as racism, are influencing patterns of care and consider changes to acknowledge and address them. Reviews should stratify patient data by demographic characteristics and health related social needs to appropriately identify differences among unique populations and assess the drivers of gaps and disparities and identify interventions appropriate for the needs of the sub-populations.",

The CDS Hooks and SMART-on-FHIR interoperability interface standards provide two   ways to integrate with the clinical workflow in a way that complements existing displays and information pre-visit, during visit, and for post-visit follow-up.
