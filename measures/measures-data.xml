    <description>Empanel (assign responsibility for) the total population, linking each patient to a MIPS eligible clinician or group or care team.

Empanelment is a series of processes that assign each active patient to a MIPS eligible clinician or group and/or care team, confirm assignment with patients and clinicians, and use the resultant patient panels as a foundation for individual patient and population health management. 

Empanelment identifies the patients and population for whom the MIPS eligible clinician or group and/or care team is responsible and is the foundation for the relationship continuity between patient and MIPS eligible clinician or group /care team that is at the heart of comprehensive primary care. Effective empanelment requires identification of the "active population" of the practice: those patients who identify and use your practice as a source for primary care. There are many ways to define "active patients" operationally, but generally, the definition of "active patients" includes patients who have sought care within the last 24 to 36 months, allowing inclusion of younger patients who have minimal acute or preventive health care.</description>

      <description>Percentage of patients evaluated in an outpatient setting who within the previous 12 months have experienced an acute myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), cardiac valve surgery, or cardiac transplantation, or who have chronic stable angina (CSA) and have not already participated in an early outpatient cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention (CR) program for the qualifying event/diagnosis who were referred to a CR program Definition: Referral - A referral is defined as an official communication between the health care provider and the patient to recommend and carry out a referral order to an outpatient CR program. This includes the provision of all necessary information to the patient that will allow the patient to enroll in an outpatient CR program. This also includes a written or electronic communication between the healthcare provider or healthcare system and the cardiac rehabilitation program that includes the patient's enrollment information for the program. A hospital discharge summary or office note may potentially be formatted to include the necessary patient information to communicate to the CR program (the patient’s cardiovascular history, testing, and treatments, for instance). According to standards of practice for cardiac rehabilitation programs, care coordination communications are sent to the referring provider, including any issues regarding treatment changes, adverse treatment responses, or new non-emergency condition (new symptoms, patient care questions, etc.) that need attention by the referring provider. These communications also include a progress report once the patient has completed the program. All communications must maintain an appropriate level of confidentiality as outlined by the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Note: A patient with a qualifying diagnosis should have a referral to CR within the subsequent 12 months. In the event that the patient has a second (recurrent) qualifying event before the original 12 month “referral” period has ended, a new 12 month “referral” period for CR referral starts at the time of the second qualifying event, since the patient again becomes eligible for CR at that time.</description>

    <title>Head CT or MRI Scan Results for Acute Ischemic Stroke or Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients who Received Head CT or MRI Scan Interpretation within 45 minutes of ED Arrival</title>
    <description>This measure calculates the percentage of acute ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke patients who arrive at the ED within two hours of the onset of symptoms and have a head computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan interpreted within 45 minutes of ED arrival.  This measure is included in the CMS Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (HOQR) system measure portfolio.

HOQR is a quality data-reporting program, implemented by CMS for outpatient hospital services. Under this program, hospitals report data using standardized measures of care to receive the full annual update to their Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) payment rate, effective for payments beginning in calendar year 2009. To meet HOQR Program requirements and receive the full Annual Payment Update (APU) under the OPPS, hospitals must meet administrative, data collection and submission, and data validation requirements. Participating hospitals agree that they will allow CMS to publicly report data for the quality measures (as stated in the current OPPS Final Rule). In the context of this quality measure reporting program, NQF #0661 is referred to as ´OP-23.´</description>

    <title>Knee Arthroscopy for Meniscectomy</title>
    <description>The change in a validated knee measure score will be used as a performance measure for surgeons performing knee arthroscopy for meniscectomy. Two measures will be created and reported by each surgeon. Surgeons will report the average knee measure change score for patients treated during the observation period. In addition, surgeons will produce a risk-adjusted knee measure change score ratio by dividing the average patient knee measure change score by the average predicted patient knee measure change score calculated using the formula provided. These measures will serve as sports medicine performance measures at the eligible surgeon level. Eligible validated knee patient reported outcome measures include: International Knee Documental Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form (Pedi-IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) [1]. Defining the population: CPT-4 procedure codes will be used to identify patients who received knee arthroscopy for meniscectomy. Isolated Meniscectomy during the reporting period CPT-4 Codes: 29880, 29881. Excluding concurrent with Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (29888) and other concomitant procedures. Surgeons who performed a minimum of 25 meniscectomy procedures a year will be eligible to submit this measure. Time period for data collection and reporting: This measure will be calculated using all patients who underwent meniscectomy during the observation period. Patients receiving meniscectomy during the period 18 to 6 months prior to the reporting data will be included in the analysis to ensure 6 months of patient-reported follow-up in the knee measure score are available. Measures: Two surgeon-level performance measures will be reported. The unadjusted measure will be the average 6-month knee measure change score across all meniscectomy patients treated by the surgeon. The adjusted measure will be the ratio of the average knee measure change score divided by the average predicted knee measure change score for all patients treated by the surgeon. Unadjusted measure: Average Knee Measure Change Score. NUMERATOR: Sum of knee measure change scores from pre-surgery to 6-months post-surgery across all meniscectomy patients in the denominator. DENOMINATOR: The number of all patients who received meniscectomy during the observation window from the surgeon. Type of score: Validated knee measure change score average. Risk adjusted measure: Knee Measure Change Score Ratio. NUMERATOR: Average 6-month knee measure change score for all meniscectomy patients treated by surgeon. DENOMINATOR: Average predicted 6-month knee measure change score for all meniscectomy patients treated by surgeon. Risk adjustment methods and variables: The predicted 6 month knee measure change scores are estimated for each patient using the Center for Effectiveness Research in Orthopaedics’ (CERortho) risk adjustment regression model that includes the following patient variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, history or prior knee surgery, sport participation/activity level, osteoarthritis, concomitant chondral injury, the baseline knee measure, and baseline measures of pain, knee function, and quality of life.[2-4]. Variables included in the current CERortho risk model are based on information in available databases. CERortho plans to constantly update these specified variables based on input from evaluated surgeons and specialty organizations. Appendix A contains the list of baseline concepts from peer-reviewed literature that are thought to affect outcomes of treatment and will be candidates for future inclusion in the model. Type of score: Ratio score; Interpretation of score: Surgeons with ratio scores equal to 1 have quality scores equal to the average surgeon given the characteristics of their patients. Surgeons with ratio scores greater than 1 had knee change scores higher than average. Surgeons with ratios scores less than 1 had knee change scores lower than average given the characteristics of their patients. Definitions: Patient’s Knee Measure Score: A knee measure score is produced when the patient answers a validated knee assessment administered in the clinic or through an online portal. Patient’s Knee Measure Change Score: A patient’s change score is calculated by subtracting the patient’s knee measure score at baseline from the patient’s knee measure score at 6 months. Patient’s Knee Measure Predicted Adjusted Change Score: Knee measure change scores for patients are risk adjusted using a regression model that includes the following independent variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, history or prior knee surgery, sport participation/activity level, osteoarthritis, concomitant chondral injury, the baseline knee measure, and baseline measures of pain, knee function, and quality of life.[2-4] The patient’s predicted knee measure change score is the dependent variable. The regression model produces a risk-adjusted predicted knee measure change score for each patient. Risk-adjusted Knee Measure Change Score Ratio: The ratio between the actual change scores and the predicted change scores (after risk adjustment) is the ratio score. The risk-adjusted knee measure change score represents risk-adjusted change corrected for patient characteristics. A risk-adjusted ratio score of one or greater should be interpreted as change scores that were as good as or better than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. Risk-adjusted ratio change scores less than one should be interpreted as knee measure change scores that were less than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. The surgeon ratio scores can be used to make comparisons across surgeons. Steps: 1. Prior to meniscectomy surgery the patient completes a baseline validated knee measure assessment which generates the patient’s knee measure score at baseline; 2. Six months after surgery, the patient completes the same validated knee measure assessment again, which generates the patient’s knee measure score at 6 months; 3. The patient’s raw, unadjusted knee measure change score is generated by subtracting the baseline score from the 6-month score; Unadjusted measure: 4. Patients’ knee measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. Adjusted measure:  5. A risk-adjusted knee measure change score is predicted using the CERortho risk-adjustment regression model. 6. Patients’ unadjusted and adjusted knee measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. 7. A risk-adjusted Knee Measure Change Score Ratio is generated for each surgeon. 8.The ratio scores for all surgeons in the database are ranked. See attached for references...</description>

    <description>The change in a validated shoulder measure score will be used as a performance measure for surgeons performing shoulder arthroplasty which includes hemiarthroplasty, total anatomical and reverse arthroplasty procedures. Two measures will be created and reported by each surgeon. Surgeons will report the average shoulder measure change score for patients treated during the observation period. In addition, surgeons will produce a risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score ratio by dividing the average patient shoulder measure change score by the average predicted patient shoulder measure change score calculated using the formula provided. These measures will serve as sports medicine performance measures at the eligible surgeon level. Eligible validated shoulder patient reported outcome measures include: American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) [1] Defining the population: CPT-4 codes will be used to identify patients who received shoulder arthroplasty surgery. Shoulder arthroplasty during the reporting period CPT-4 Codes: 23470, 23472 (excluding 23 473 and 23474). Surgeons who performed a minimum of 25 shoulder arthroplasty procedures a year will be eligible to submit this measure. Time period for data collection and reporting: This measure will be calculated using all patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty during the observation period. Patients receiving shoulder arthroplasty during the period 18 to 6 months prior to the reporting data will be included in the analysis to ensure 6 months of patient-reported follow-up in the shoulder measure score are available. Measures: Two surgeon-level performance measures will be reported. The unadjusted measure will be the average 6-month shoulder measure change score across all shoulder arthroplasty patients treated by the surgeon. The adjusted measure will be the ratio of the average shoulder measure change score divided by the average predicted shoulder measure change score for all patients treated by the surgeon. Unadjusted measure: Average Shoulder Measure Change Score NUMERATOR: Sum of shoulder measure change scores from pre-surgery to 6-months post-surgery across all shoulder arthroplasty patients in the denominator. DENOMINATOR: The number of all patients who received shoulder arthroplasty during the observation window from the surgeon. Type of score: Validated shoulder measure change score average Risk adjusted measure: Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio NUMERATOR: Average 6-month shoulder measure change score for all shoulder arthroplasty patients treated by surgeon. DENOMINATOR: Average predicted 6-month shoulder measure change score for all shoulder arthroplasty patients treated by surgeon. Risk adjustment methods and variables: The predicted 6-month shoulder measure change scores are estimated for each patient using the Center for Effectiveness Research in Orthopaedics’ (CERortho) risk adjustment regression model that includes the following patient variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, prior shoulder surgery, fracture, glenoid type, arthroplasty type (reverse vs. traditional total, hemi), the baseline shoulder measure, and baseline measures of pain, shoulder function, and quality of life.[2-6] Variables included in the current CERortho risk model are based on information in available databases. CERortho plans to constantly update these specified variables based on input from evaluated surgeons and specialty organizations. Appendix A contains the list of baseline concepts from peer-reviewed literature that are thought to affect outcomes of treatment and will be candidates for future inclusion in the model. Type of score: Ratio score Interpretation of score: Surgeons with ratio scores equal to 1 have quality scores equal to the average surgeon given the characteristics of their patients. Surgeons with ratio scores greater than 1 had shoulder change scores higher than average. Surgeons with ratios scores less than 1 had shoulder change scores lower than average given the characteristics of their patients. Definitions: Patient’s Shoulder Measure Score: A shoulder measure score is produced when the patient answers a validated shoulder assessment administered in the clinic or through an online portal. Patient’s Shoulder Measure Change Score: A patient’s change score is calculated by subtracting the patient’s shoulder measure score at baseline from the patient’s shoulder measure score at 6 months. Patient’s Shoulder Measure Predicted Adjusted Change Score: Shoulder measure change scores for patients are risk adjusted using a regression model that includes the following independent variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, prior shoulder surgery, fracture, glenoid type, arthroplasty type (reverse vs. traditional total, hemi), the baseline shoulder measure, and baseline measures of pain, shoulder function, and quality of life.[2-6] The patient’s predicted shoulder measure change score is the dependent variable. The regression model produces a risk-adjusted predicted shoulder measure change score for each patient. Risk-adjusted Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio: The ratio between the actual change scores and the predicted change scores (after risk adjustment) is the ratio score. The risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score represents risk-adjusted change corrected for patient characteristics. A risk-adjusted ratio score of one or greater should be interpreted as change scores that were as good as or better than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. Risk-adjusted ratio change scores less than one should be interpreted as shoulder measure change scores that were less than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. The surgeon ratio scores can be used to make comparisons across surgeons. Steps: 1. Prior to shoulder arthroplasty surgery the patient completes a baseline validated shoulder measure assessment which generates the patient’s shoulder measure score at baseline. 2. Six months after surgery, the patient completes the same validated shoulder measure assessment again, which generates the patient’s shoulder measure score at 6 months. 3. The patient’s raw, unadjusted shoulder measure change score is generated by subtracting the baseline score from the 6-month score. Unadjusted measure: 4. Patients’ shoulder measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. Adjusted measure: 5. A risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score is predicted using the CERortho risk-adjustment regression model. 6. Patients’ unadjusted and adjusted shoulder measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. 7. A risk-adjusted Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio is generated for each surgeon. 8. The ratio scores for all surgeons in the database are ranked. See attachment for references.</description>

    <title>Knee Arthroscopy for Meniscal Repair: Change in a Validated Knee Patient Reported Outcome Measure Following Knee Arthroscopy for Meniscal Repair</title>
    <description>The change in a validated knee measure score will be used as a performance measure for surgeons performing knee arthroscopy for meniscal repair. Two measures will be created and reported by each surgeon. Surgeons will report the average knee measure change score for patients treated during the observation period. In addition, surgeons will produce a risk-adjusted knee measure change score ratio by dividing the average patient knee measure change score by the average predicted patient knee measure change score calculated using the formula provided. These measures will serve as sports medicine performance measures at the eligible surgeon level. Eligible validated knee patient reported outcome measures include: International Knee Documental Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form (Pedi-IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) [1]Defining the population:
CPT-4 procedure codes will be used to identify patients who received knee arthroscopy for meniscal repair. Meniscal repair during the reporting period CPT-4 Codes: 29882, 29883. Excluding concurrent procedures including Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (29888). Surgeons who performed a minimum of 25 meniscal repair procedures a year will be eligible to submit this measure.Time period for data collection and reporting:
This measure will be calculated using all patients who underwent meniscal repair during the observation period. Patients receiving meniscal repair during the period 18 to 6 months prior to the reporting data will be included in the analysis to ensure 6 months of patient-reported follow-up in the knee measure score are available. Measures: Two surgeon-level performance measures will be reported. The unadjusted measure will be the average 6-month knee measure change score across all meniscal repair patients treated by the surgeon. The adjusted measure will be the ratio of the average knee measure change score divided by the average predicted knee measure change score for all patients treated by the surgeon. Unadjusted measure: Average Knee Measure Change Score. NUMERATOR: Sum of knee measure change scores from pre-surgery to 6-months post-surgery across all meniscal repair patients in the denominator. DENOMINATOR: The number of all patients who received meniscal repair during the observation window from the surgeon. Type of score: Validated knee measure change score average; Risk adjusted measure: Knee Measure Change Score Ratio. NUMERATOR: Average 6-month knee measure change score for all meniscal repair patients treated by surgeon. DENOMINATOR: Average predicted 6-month knee measure change score for all meniscal repair patients treated by surgeon. Risk adjustment methods and variables: The predicted 6-month knee measure change scores are estimated for each patient using the Center for Effectiveness Research in Orthopaedics’ (CERortho) risk adjustment regression model that includes the following patient variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, history or prior knee surgery, sport participation/activity level, osteoarthritis, concomitant chondral injury, the baseline knee measure, and baseline measures of pain, knee function, and quality of life.[2-4] Variables included in the current CERortho risk model are based on information in available databases. CERortho plans to constantly update these specified variables based on input from evaluated surgeons and specialty organizations. Appendix A contains the list of baseline concepts from peer-reviewed literature that are thought to affect outcomes of treatment and will be candidates for future inclusion in the model.
Type of score: Ratio score
Interpretation of score:
Surgeons with ratio scores equal to 1 have quality scores equal to the average surgeon given the characteristics of their patients. Surgeons with ratio scores greater than 1 had knee change scores higher than average. Surgeons with ratios scores less than 1 had knee change scores lower than average given the characteristics of their patients. Definitions:
Patient’s Knee Measure Score: A knee measure score is produced when the patient answers a validated knee assessment administered in the clinic or through an online portal.
Patient’s Knee Measure Change Score: A patient’s change score is calculated by subtracting the patient’s knee measure score at baseline from the patient’s knee measure score at 6 months.Patient’s Knee Measure Predicted Adjusted Change Score: Knee measure change scores for patients are risk adjusted using a regression model that includes the following independent variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, history or prior knee surgery, sport participation/activity level, osteoarthritis, concomitant chondral injury, the baseline knee measure, and baseline measures of pain, knee function, and quality of life.[2-4] The patient’s predicted knee measure change score is the dependent variable. The regression model produces a risk-adjusted predicted knee measure change score for each patient.Risk-adjusted Knee Measure Change Score Ratio: The ratio between the actual change scores and the predicted change scores (after risk adjustment) is the ratio score. The risk-adjusted knee measure change score represents risk-adjusted change corrected for patient characteristics. A risk-adjusted ratio score of one or greater should be interpreted as change scores that were as good as or better than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. Risk-adjusted ratio change scores less than one should be interpreted as knee measure change scores that were less than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient.The surgeon ratio scores can be used to make comparisons across surgeons. Steps: 1. Prior to meniscal repair surgery the patient completes a baseline validated knee measure assessment which generates the patient’s knee measure score at baseline. 2. Six months after surgery, the patient completes the same validated knee measure assessment again, which generates the patient’s knee measure score at 6 months. 3. The patient’s raw, unadjusted knee measure change score is generated by subtracting the baseline score from the 6-month score. Unadjusted measure: 4. Patients’ knee measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. Adjusted measure: 5. A risk-adjusted knee measure change score is predicted using the CERortho risk-adjustment regression model. 6. Patients’ unadjusted and adjusted knee measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. 7. A risk-adjusted Knee Measure Change Score Ratio is generated for each surgeon. 8. The ratio scores for all surgeons in the database are ranked. See attachment for references.</description>

    <title>Objectifying pain and/or functionality to determine manipulative medicine efficacy with correlative treatment adjustment.</title>
    <description>Successful Reporting: Successful reporting would include a validated QVAS or similarly validated tool showing for pain and functionality show either:
 a. A two (2) point pain improvement since last clinical encounter with the treating provider or maintenance of a functional improvement greater than or equal to a six (&gt;6).
 b. If functionality 5 or less and/or pain 7 or more, medical record documentation of treatment change or diagnostic work up is present.
 c. Failure to document these changes with continued treatment despite lessening functionality and/or increasing pain would result in measure failure.

 Measure explanation:
 a. Utilizes Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale (QVAS) or similarly validated tool for pain related patient encounters to assess and document efficacy, functional, clinical and/or pain improvement of at least two points (a two-point reduction to show improvement) or a functionality &gt; 6 to show functional improvement is maintained with current treatment. Pain scale maintained between 4-6 for good control with current treatment regimen and/or a two-point improvement in pain since last visit for treatment with or without treatment adjustments. If this fails to occur provider changes technique or considers other intervention (i.e.: further diagnostics, referral, injections, prescription medication).
 b. If provider changes manipulative technique at the previous visit he/she uses QVAS at the subsequent visit to assess impact of change in technique or intervention on current pain state where patient’s pain is above a 6 on a 0-10 scale with 0 being no pain and 10 greatest pain and/or functionality is &lt; 6 on a 0- 10 scale with 10 most and 0 least functional. Pain scale maintained between 4-6 for good control with current treatment regimen and/or a two-point improvement in pain since last visit for treatment with or without treatment adjustments. If this fails to occur provider changes technique or considers other intervention (i.e.: further diagnostics, referral, injections, prescription medication).

Rate 1: Percentage of patients receiving manipulative medicine with a QVAS score and treatment adjustment/maintenance for low back pain.
Rate 2: Percentage of patients receiving manipulative medicine with a QVAS score and treatment adjustment/maintenance for neck pain.</description>

    <title>Appropriate use of advanced imaging by ordering provider with glucocorticoid management to spare motor neuron loss when physical findings suggest neuropathic etiology.</title>
    <description>Successful Reporting: Successful reporting would include &gt;80% of encounters where advanced imaging was done only subsequent to an Evaluation and Management (E&amp;M) encounter where the physical examination included appropriate and focal neurologic and/or musculoskeletal evaluations that support the imaging study(ies) being ordered. Correlative documentation of an oral corticosteroid (i.e. prednisone) prescription given in the face of pending advanced diagnostic imaging (i.e. CT or MRI) when documented symptoms or physical findings warrant utilization AND no contraindications to medications exist. Successful reporting of this measure would be the aforementioned medical record documentation with and at the time of the CPT/ICD combinations noted in the reporting year.

 Measure explanation: Neurologic examination and/or focused musculoskeletal examination relative to symptomatic complaints documented prior to ordering MRI or CT Scan of neck or lumbar/lumbosacral spine for low back pain complaint. Corticosteroids/glucocorticoids given for symptomatic radicular pain and/or paresthesias with neurologic examination positive or equivocal, while advanced diagnostic imaging (i.e.: CT or MRI) is pending.</description>

    <title>Appropriate controlled substance prescribing (definitive diagnosis(es)) via adherence to Controlled Substance Agreements (CSA) or (OA's) with corrective action taken for pain and/or substance use disorder patients when violations occur.</title>
    <description>Successful Reporting:
 a. Documentation of definitive pathology (e.g., imaging, surgical report, serology, provider referral for addiction/substance use disorder, etc.) to warrant chronic pain and/or buprenorphine/naloxone medication chronically.
 b. Provider must document signing of a Controlled Substance (CSA) or Opiate Agreement (OA) if more than two (2) Schedule II controlled substance prescriptions are provided to a patient in a 12-month period. Understandably, prescriptions may occur in the prior reporting year as well as in the current reporting year.
 c. For all patients violating existing CSA/OA, such violations are documented with correlative adjustments in treatment (e.g.: shorter duration prescriptions (2 week to 4 week), increased frequency of urine drug screens (quarterly to monthly), random pill counts, more frequent visits, etc.).

Measure explanation: Chronic Pain medication prescribed (prescribed for greater than one week or more than twice a year) only after a diagnosis and medical or surgical plan has been implemented. CSA or OA followed and, if actionable violation (i.e.: Urine Drug Screen inappropriate, pill counts off, multiple providers prescribing, polypharmacy, etc.) corrective action taken (i.e.: probation, escalated use of Urine Drug Screens, shorter prescriptions intervals, termination of controlled prescribing or similar actions) as result of the CSA/OA violation.</description>

    <title>Urine Drug Screen Utilization in Pain Management and Substance Use Disorders; no less than quarterly for pain and no less than monthly for substance use disorders.</title>
    <description>Successful Reporting: Provider must document signing of a Controlled Substance Agreement (CSA) or Opiate Agreement (OA) if more than two (2) Schedule II controlled substance prescriptions are provided to a patient in a 12-month period. Understandably, prescriptions may occur in the prior reporting year as well as in the current reporting year. Documented urine drug screens (UDS) performed no less than quarterly on all pain patients and monthly for all substance use disorder patients with documented evidence of additional UDS if suspected diversion, illicit activity, or other red flags noted during the reporting year. Failure to perform the above frequency of UDS at a minimum, results in failure of this measure. Additionally, failure to increase regulatory scrutiny for red flags, diversion and/or illicit behavior (i.e.: problematic urines or pill counts) in the form of increased performance of urine drug screens via probationary periods and/or shorter prescribing periods and/or pill counts will result in measure failure.

Measure explanation: Controlled substance agreement (CSA) or opiate agreement (OA) utilized on all patients received greater than two Schedule II controlled substance prescriptions in a 12-month period.</description>

    <title>Addressing anxiety in pain patients with SNRI and SSRIs and reducing/eliminating benzodiazepines for chronic anxiety.</title>
    <description>Successful Reporting: Chronic pain patients with anxiety symptoms will be provided an SNRI/SSRI prescription and not acutely given benzodiazepines as documented in the medical record and medication list. Patients with chronic pain on benzodiazepines will have those drugs serially weaned and replaced by SNRI/SSRI agents unless a defined anxiety syndrome exists, is documented by a psychiatric provider and this comorbid state is verified.

 Measure explanation: Benzodiazepines are implicated in polypharmacy overdose deaths and are often prescribed for sleep or anxiety symptoms. Pain patients typically have deficits in serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) secondary to pain chronicity and physiologic response. NE and 5-HT block pain in the ascending spine and deficiencies are associated with increased pain and the primary presenting symptom of 5- HT deficiency is anxiety. As such, appropriate management warrants utilization of SNRI/SSRI agents in this setting in lieu of benzodiazepines.</description>

    <title>Weight loss in pain patients with BMI &gt;30 with opiate utilization for weight related pain conditions rather than opiate dose escalation for improved pain control.</title>
    <description>Successful Reporting: In chronic pain patients with weight related or weight exacerbated pain conditions (i.e.: DJD, DDD, Hip Pain/OA, Knee Pain/OA, Foot/Ankle Pain/OA, Pes Planus related plantar fasciitis) BMI will be documented and monitored at scheduled visits with serial reduction in BMI over the reporting period with correlative dose reduction (24 hour MME) of opiate/opioid therapy.

Measure explanation: Pain conditions that can be treated definitively to avoid or cease opiate/opioid utilization should engage such treatment. Obesity, if causally related to pain, disease progression, and/or the major etiologic event must be addressed. Dose escalation for BMI escalation or maintenance is harmful and potentially dangerous to patients categorized as obese due to respiratory suppression and opiate/opioid related systemic endocrine dysfunction. Obesity is treatable. Pain medication may be needed initially help patients exercise and function to address pain in both weight bearing and non-weight bearing joints affected by obesity. However, weight reduction should eventually reduce opiate need and dosing if monitored, addressed and treated as part of comprehensive pain management.</description>

    <title>Treatment of spinal stenosis with manipulative medicine and alternative medicine modalities.</title>
    <description>Successful Reporting: Successful reporting would include a validated QVAS or similarly validated tool showing for pain and functionality show a two (2) point pain improvement since last clinical encounter with the treating provider or maintenance of a functional improvement greater than or equal to a six (&gt;6). If functionality 5 or less and/or pain 7 or more, medical record documentation of treatment change or diagnostic work up is present. Failure to document these changes with continued treatment despite lessening functionality and/or increasing pain would result in measure failure.

Providers would be providing manual medicine in addition to non-traditional, but literature proven alternative medicine modalities (i.e.: acupuncture) with patients who have imaging confirmed spinal stenosis (M99 ICD-10 Code).

Measure explanation: Spinal stenosis typically is conservatively managed until surgical fusion or foraminotomy is necessitated based upon pain or neuropathic progression necessitating spinal fusion and/or foraminotomy. These surgeries carry risk to the patient and major expense to the system. Moreover, once a spinal fusion occurs, typically the areas above and/or below this area are fused in another 5-10 years. Avoiding the initial surgery is the only means to avoid subsequent surgeries and the associated risks and costs. Manipulative medicine combined with alternative medical therapies have been shown to improve pain and avoid surgical intervention, thus, this measure is designed to report such treatment.</description>

    <title>General Health Postoperative Improvement</title>
    <description>Performance Measure #1 - Change in the calculated score of a validated general health patient reported outcome survey from before to after surgery.

Performance Measure #2 - The overall percentage of patients that improve their general health scores beyond a minimum threshold for each postoperative interval.

Instructions: Patients who undergo a surgical procedure are asked to complete a general health outcomes survey both preoperatively and following surgery.

Rationale: Understanding a patient’s mental and general physical improvement as a result of surgery is an important aspect of clinical care. The general health scores that are calculated can be used to improve a specific patient’s care plan or can be analyzed retrospectively to modify overall treatment methodologies. In addition, general health scores can be used to risk adjust other, surgery specific outcomes scores that are collected. Doctors have the option of collecting a postoperative general health survey at different intervals following surgery to account for different surgery types and physician follow-up patterns.</description>

    <description>The measures reflects the percent of patients receiving spine surgery who report an improvement in back or neck pain that is equal to, or greater than, the standard "Minimum Clinically Important Difference" for the specific measures used in MSSIC to assess back or neck pain. The MCID values are standard values (e.g., 1.75 points or more on a 0-10 rating scale) obtained from published articles, and are specific to spine surgery. The ideal value for the measure is 100% (all patients got better), but actual values are lower than that and vary significantly from hospital to hospital and surgeon to surgeon.

 Rates are reported on a risk-adjusted basis, with the risk adjustment model based on a set of demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as case-mix variables (e.g., fusion vs. non-fusion) so that rates are truly comparable from surgeon to surgeon. Although it is a rare situation, patients with baseline scores so low as to not allow for an improvement larger than the MCID are excluded from the rate calculation. (Patients with myelopathy as an indication for surgery, for example, may not have pain.)</description>

    <title>Percent of patients achieving MCID for pain-related disability (ODI/NDI)</title>
    <description>The measures reflects the percent of patients receiving spine surgery who report an improvement in pain-related disability that is equal to, or greater than, the standard "Minimum Clinically Important Difference" for the specific measures used in MSSIC to assess back or neck pain. The MCID values are standard values (e.g., 1.75 points or more on a 0-10 rating scale) obtained from published articles, and are specific to spine surgery. The ideal value for the measure is 100% (all patients got better), but actual values are lower than that and vary significantly from hospital to hospital and surgeon to surgeon.

 Rates are reported on a risk-adjusted basis, with the risk adjustment model based on a set of demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as case-mix variables (e.g., fusion vs. non-fusion) so that rates are truly comparable from surgeon to surgeon. Although it is a rare situation, patients with baseline scores so low as to not allow for an improvement larger than the MCID are excluded from the rate calculation. (Patients with myelopathy as an indication for surgery, for example, may not have pain.)</description>

    <title>Percent same-day ambulation</title>
    <description>The measures reflects the percent of patients receiving spine surgery for whom there is medical record evidence of ambulation (actual movement out of the bed, not just feet dangling out of bed) on the day of surgery. Analysis of MSSIC data in 2016 showed the early ambulation is a significant protective factor for a variety of complications, and that there is currently significant variability among hospitals and surgeons in terms of the percent of patients who do have ambulation on the day of surgery.</description>

    <title>Rate of use of Pre-op skin preparation/wash</title>
    <description>The measures reflects the percent of patients receiving spine surgery for whom there is medical record evidence of use of evidence-based interventions to prevent surgical site infection (SSI). SSI is a relatively rare but serious complication of surgery, and is preventable to some extent by specific pre-surgical site preparation done by patients the day before surgery. Data from MSSIC suggests significant variability among surgeons and among hospitals in terms of the percent of patients for whom a formal pre-surgical wash preparation is used.</description>

    <title>Otitis Media with Effusion: Antihistamines or Decongestants – Avoidance of Inappropriate Use</title>
    <description>"Description: Percentage of patients aged 2 months through 12 years with a diagnosis of OME who were not prescribed or recommended to receive either antihistamines or decongestants
 Rationale: OME usually resolves spontaneously with indications for therapy only if the condition is persistent and clinically significant benefits can be achieved. No data exists to support antihistamines and decongestants in treating OME. As a result, physicians should not prescribe or recommend the over-the-counter use of these medications.
 The purpose of the corresponding guideline statement is to reduce ineffective and potentially harmful medical interventions in OME when there is no long-term benefit to be gained in the vast majority of cases. Medications have long been used to treat OME, with the dual goals of improving QOL and avoiding more invasive surgical interventions. Both the 1994 guidelines and the 2004 guidelines determined that the weight of evidence did not support the routine use of steroids (either oral or intranasal), antimicrobials, antihistamines, or decongestants as therapy for OME.

 Evidence: STATEMENT 8c. ANTIHISTAMINES OR DECONGESTANTS: Clinicians should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. Strong recommendation against based on systematic review of RCTs and preponderance of harm over benefit.

    <title>Otitis Media with Effusion: Avoidance of Topical Intranasal Corticosteroids</title>
    <description>"Description: Percentage of patients aged 2 months through 12 years with a diagnosis of OME who were not prescribed topical intranasal corticosteroids

 Rationale: OME usually resolves spontaneously with indications for therapy only if the condition is persistent and clinically significant benefits can be achieved. In children aged 4 to 11 years, there was no difference in the resolution of effusion or hearing loss over 3 months between children treated with nasal mometasone or placebo; in fact, there was an economic disadvantage in the group treated with mometasone, considering the high rate of spontaneous resolution in the placebo group. Furthermore, 7% to 22% of study group patients experienced minor adverse effects.

 The purpose of the corresponding guideline action statement is to reduce ineffective and potentially harmful medical interventions in OME when there is no long-term benefit to be gained in the majority of cases. Medications have long been used to treat OME, with the dual goals of improving QOL and avoiding more invasive surgical interventions. Both the 1994 guidelines and the 2004 guidelines determined that the weight of evidence did not support the routine use of steroids (either oral or intranasal), antimicrobials, antihistamines, or decongestants as therapy for OME.

 Evidence: STATEMENT 8a. STEROIDS: Clinicians should recommend against using intranasal steroids or systemic steroids for treating OME. Strong recommendation against based on systematic review of RCTs and preponderance of harm over benefit.

    <title>Excess Days Rate and Degree of Excess (Including Physician Response)</title>
    <description>This is a two-part measure, measuring rate of discharges with no excess days and, where excess days occur, the rate of overly excess days. Physician feedback is required to satisfy requirements. Patients will be assigned to a physician’s Registry based on identification within the Hospital Quality dataset. The patient will be matched to existing patient data within this physician’s source system using the standard Roji Health Intelligence patient-matching algorithm (utilizing the data elements listed previously). Patients within the data who cannot be matched to patients within the physician source system data will be displayed, but flagged for review and validation.
Rate 1: the percentage of discharges without excess days out of the total of all-cause discharges for patients aged 18 years and older.
Rate 2: the percentage of discharges with excess days where clinician provided the required feedback AND where excess days numbered less than 3, out of the total number of discharges with excess days.</description>

    <title>Rate of Follow Up Visits Within 7 Days of Discharge (Including Physician Response)</title>
    <description>This is a two-part measure, measuring whether patients were seen in a timely fashion in the ambulatory setting after discharge.  Physician feedback is required to satisfy requirements. Patients will be assigned to a physician’s Registry based on identification within the Hospital Quality dataset. The patient will be matched to existing patient data within this physician’s source system using the standard Roji Health Intelligence patient-matching algorithm (utilizing the data elements listed previously). Patients within the data who cannot be matched to patients within the physician source system data will be displayed, but flagged for review and validation.
Rate 1: the percentage of discharges where there is a subsequent office visit within seven days out of the total number of of all-cause discharges for patients aged 18 years and older.
Rate 2: the percentage of discharges without subsequent office visits within 7 days where clinician provided required feedback AND where re-admission within 30 days did not occur, out of the total number of all-cause discharges for patients aged 18 years and older.</description>

This measure is intended to encourage the administration of CG-CAHPS to all patients at each visit and to ensure that attention is focused on the actionable items in the instrument, as summarized in four of the composites: Getting Timely Appointments, Care, and Information;How Well Providers Communicate With Patients; Helpful, Courteous, and Respectful Office Staff; and Follow-up on Test Results. This questionnaire is collected like any other patient reported outcome by the QCDR; it differs from the "CAHPS for MIPS" in that it is much shorter and does not require a special vendor.</description>

Using the MNA Short Form algorithm, if a patient at risk of malnutrition has an MNA score of 8-11 and documented weight loss, the clinician would be provided with general treatment, monitoring or rescreening recommendations. These include: nutrition interventions (e.g. diet enhancement and oral supplementation of 400 kcal/d2), close weight monitoring, and a more in depth nutrition assessment. Malnourished patients with scores of 0-7 would be offered treatment with nutritional intervention (ONS 400-600 kcal/d2 and diet enhancement), close weight monitoring and a more in depth nutrition assessment. No specific products will be recommended as part of the measure.</description>

    <description>The percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of a wound or ulcer of any type who self-report nutritional screening with a validated tool (such as the Self-MNA® by Nestlé) within the 12-month reporting period.

Using the Self-MNA® by Nestlé, if a patient at risk of malnutrition has an MNA score of 8-11 and documented weight loss, the clinician should subsequently create a follow up plan (e.g. diet enhancement and oral supplementation of 400 kcal/d2), close weight monitoring, and a more in depth nutrition assessment. Malnourished patients with scores of 0-7 would be offered treatment with nutritional intervention (ONS 400-600 kcal/d2 and diet enhancement), close weight monitoring and a more in depth nutrition assessment. No specific products will be recommended as part of the measure. Implementation of an intervention plan based on nutritional screening is CDR measure 20.</description>

    <title>Venous Leg Ulcer outcome measure: Healing or Closure</title>
    <description>Percentage of venous leg ulcers among patients age 18 or older that have achieved healing or closure within 12 months, stratified by the Wound Healing Index. Healing or closure is defined as complete epithelialization without drainage or the need for a dressing over the closed ulceration, although venous compression would still be required.

There are four rates reported for this measure.
Three of the rates will be risk stratified into three buckets (minimum-maximum) which are the following:
Rate 1: 0.00-73.24
Rate 2: 73.24-80.26
Rate 3: 80.26-87.21
Rate 4: The average of the three risk stratified buckets which will be the performance rate in the XML submitted.</description>

    <title>Nutritional Screening and Intervention Plan in Patients with Chronic Wounds and Ulcers</title>
    <description>The percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of a wound or ulcer of any type who undergo nutritional screening with a validated tool (such as the Nestlé MNA) within the 12 month reporting period, and for whom an appropriate nutritional intervention was ordered based on the results of the tool. Using the MNA Short Form algorithm, if a patient at risk of malnutrition has an MNA score of 8-11 and documented weight loss, the clinician would be provided with general treatment, monitoring or rescreening recommendations. These include: nutrition interventions (e.g. diet enhancement and oral supplementation of 400 kcal/d2 ), close weight monitoring, and a more in depth nutrition assessment. Malnourished patients with scores of 0-7 would be offered treatment with nutritional intervention (ONS 400-600 kcal/d2 and diet enhancement), close weight monitoring and a more in depth nutrition assessment. No specific products will be recommended as part of the measure.</description>
