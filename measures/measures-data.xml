Patients are being managed according to validated electronic decision support and clinical management tools that involve systematic and coordinated care, incorporating comprehensive patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and patient communication of results and dosing decisions;

For rural or remote patients, patients are managed using remote monitoring or telehealth options that involve systematic and coordinated care, incorporating comprehensive patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and patient communication of results and dosing decisions; and/or

For patients who demonstrate motivation, competency, and adherence, patients are managed using either a patient self-testing (PST) or patient-self-management (PSM) program.

The performance threshold will increase to 75 percent for the second performance year and onward.
Clinicians would attest that, 60 percent for first year, or 75 percent for the second year, of their ambulatory care patients receiving warfarin participated in an anticoagulation management program for at least 90 days during the performance period.

    <description>Empanel (assign responsibility for) the total population, linking each patient to a MIPS eligible clinician or group or care team.

Empanelment is a series of processes that assign each active patient to a MIPS eligible clinician or group and/or care team, confirm assignment with patients and clinicians, and use the resultant patient panels as a foundation for individual patient and population health management. 

Empanelment identifies the patients and population for whom the MIPS eligible clinician or group and/or care team is responsible and is the foundation for the relationship continuity between patient and MIPS eligible clinician or group /care team that is at the heart of comprehensive primary care. Effective empanelment requires identification of the "active population" of the practice: those patients who identify and use your practice as a source for primary care. There are many ways to define "active patients" operationally, but generally, the definition of "active patients" includes patients who have sought care within the last 24 to 36 months, allowing inclusion of younger patients who have minimal acute or preventive health care.</description>
