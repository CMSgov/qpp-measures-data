Patient responses to ABC Scale© items may be used to directly score Balance Confidence PROM, thus allowing clinicians flexibility of choice of PROM used in routine clinical care without adding to patient response burden.

QCDR,,,,,FOTO6,,,"This is a patient-reported outcome performance measure (PRO-PM) consisting of a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) of risk-adjusted functional status (FS) change for patients aged 14 years and older with vestibular and other dizziness-related impairments. The change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Dizziness Positional Status (DPS) or Dizziness Functional Status (DFS) PROM; these are item-response theory-based PROMs developed using items from the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), scored using the T-score metric (mean=50, SD=10), with higher scores representing better FS. (1 )
The DPS and DFS measure separate domains represented within DHI items.  The DPS score will be applied to this quality measure for patients with a statistically derived DPS cut-score (T-score) of 55 or lower; the DFS score will be applied for patients with a DPS T-score of greater than 55 at initial evaluation.  This approach is consistent with clinical and research observations that two types of vestibular impairments, positional- and functional-dominant, have distinctly different clinical presentations and expected outcomes.  
Using a single PROM score derived from all 25 DHI items is not recommended due to score validity weaknesses. (2-5 Robust analyses using extensive exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses based on over 28,000 episodes of care determined the DHI items represent multiple domains that are different from those originally hypothesized, (6) thus using a single overall score would pose a threat to validity. However, patient responses to DHI items may be used to directly score the DPS and DFS, thus allowing clinicians greater flexibility of choice of PROM used in routine clinical care without adding to clinician nor patient burden.
