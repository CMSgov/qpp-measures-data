# 0. Add quality measures to the staging measures-data-quality.json file:
node scripts/measures/$currentPerformanceYear/import-quality-measures.js \
 	$quality_csv $quality_strata $quality_measures

# 1. Add PI measures to the staging measures-data-pi.json file:
node scripts/measures/$currentPerformanceYear/import-pi-measures.js \
 	$pi_csv $pi_measures

# 2. Add IA measures to the staging measures-data-ia.json file:
node scripts/measures/$currentPerformanceYear/import-ia-measures.js \
	$ia_csv $ia_measures

# Uncomment the below data set ingestion scripts as we receive the data for 2020

# 3. Add CAHPS measures to the staging cahps-measures.json file:
# node scripts/measures/$currentPerformanceYear/import-cahps-measures.js \
#	$cahps_csv $cahps_measures

# 4. Enrich `measures-data.json` file, run:
node scripts/measures/$currentPerformanceYear/enrich-measures-data.js \
	$quality_measures $ecqm_ehr_links $web_interface_links $claims_links $enriched_quality_measures
  
# 5. Add COST measures to the staging measures-data-cost.json file:
# node scripts/measures/$currentPerformanceYear/import-cost-measures.js \
#	$cost_csv $cost_measures

# 6. Merge the array/jsonfile-per-measureType into a combined array of all measures
 node scripts/measures/$currentPerformanceYear/merge-measures-data.js \
	 $ia_measures $pi_measures $enriched_quality_measures $final_measures # Note quality measures won't be in this list once enriched_quality_measures are created.
# As these datasets are created, add these to the line above: $enriched_quality_measures  $cahps_measures $cost_measures

# 7. Import and merge QCDR measures after previous measures have been built, as this has conflict-resolution logic
# node scripts/measures/$currentPerformanceYear/import-qcdr-measures.js \
#	$final_measures $qcdr_csv $qcdr_strata

# 8. Validate the resulting measures-data.json file:
echo "validating new measures-data.json"
cat measures/$currentPerformanceYear/measures-data.json | \
	node scripts/validate-data.js measures $currentPerformanceYear
