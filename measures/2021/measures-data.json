Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way).  Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient’s status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

Formally, an individual Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care score is calculated as follows:\n\nBice-Boxerman Continuity of Care =(∑_(i=1)^k n_i^2 -N)/(N(N-1)) (1)\n\nwhere k is the number of providers, n_i is the number of visits to provider i, and N is the total number of visits.

Changes in left ventricular size and function AND quantitative assessment of severity of aortic stenosis and/or mitral regurgitation should be performed in patients with significant left sided valvular lesions. Both sets of data (left ventricle structure and function, and extent of valvular disease) are needed to reach a conclusion about whether valve surgery or repair is needed. While qualitative assessments are commonly employed, they are generally inadequate to determine severity and to track changes over time.\n\nThis is a multi-strata measure consisting of the following strata: \n1. Percentage of transthoracic echocardiogram reports with at least moderate mitral regurgitation including qualitative MR severity, two quantitative MR measurements to support the qualitative severity grading, quantitative LVEF, one quantitative measurement of LV size at end diastole and end systole, AND blood pressure at time of study. \n2.
