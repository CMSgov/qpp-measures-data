This is a physician-level measure for use in evaluating physician behavior; it leverages a previously validated continuity index that quantifies the extent to which patients experience continuity of provider in their primary care visits.

This measure evaluates the extent to which primary care physicians (PCPs) are supporting the continuity of care of their patients. High care continuity is shown to improve patient outcomes and physician well-being, is associated with decreased health care costs (total, ED, inpatient, primary care, and costs for specific conditions or treatments) and health care utilization (ED visits and hospitalizations). As a byproduct of building a trusting relationship over time, issues of equity and social risk can be addressed. Physicians who perform better are likely to have specific structures and processes in place that are conducive to allowing patients to achieve higher care continuity. 

Compared to lower scores (e.g., 0.6 or lower), continuity index scores of 0.7 or higher have been associated with significantly lower Medicare expenditures and significantly lower odds of hospitalization.1

QCDR,,,,,FOTO5,,,"This is a patient-reported outcome performance measure (PRO-PM) consisting of a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) of risk-adjusted functional status (FS) change in balance confidence for patients aged 14+ with balance impairments. The change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Balance Confidence, an item-response theory-based PROM derived from the 16-items of the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale©, (1-3) scored using the T-score metric (mean=50, SD=10), with higher scores representing higher balance confidence.(4)

Patient responses to ABC Scale© items may be used to directly score Balance Confidence PROM, thus allowing clinicians  flexibility of choice of PROM used in routine clinical care without adding to patient response burden. In order to fairly measure performance between providers, this quality measure is risk-adjusted to patient characteristics known to be associated with FS outcomes and used as a performance measure the patient and provider levels to assess quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
