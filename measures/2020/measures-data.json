Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way).  Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient's status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

The CollaboRATE Shared Decision Making Score represents the proportion of top box scores, i.e. the proportion of all responses with scores of 9 for each of the four collaboRATE items. Patient must answer all 4 questions with a “top box” score in order to be numerator compliant. If a patient does not answer one of the four questions, this would not meet the intent of the measure.
