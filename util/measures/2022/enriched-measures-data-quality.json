    "description": "The Person-Centered Primary Care Measure Patient Reported Outcome Performance Measure (PCPCM PRO-PM) uses the PCPCM PROM (a comprehensive and parsimonious set of 11 patient-reported items) to assess the broad scope of primary care. Unlike other primary care measures, the PCPCM PRO-PM measures the high value aspects of primary care based on a patient's relationship with the clinician or practice. Patients identify the PCPCM PROM as meaningful and able to communicate the quality of their care to their clinicians and/or care team. The items within the PCPCM PROM are based on extensive stakeholder engagement and comprehensive reviews of the literature.",
