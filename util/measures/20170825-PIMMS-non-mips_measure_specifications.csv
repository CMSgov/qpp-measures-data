5. Composite Performance Score: Percentage of denominator-eligible patients for whom a cumulative score of 100% of blood conservation strategies was met

For MIPS performance purposes, the overall performance score is the 5th composite performance score for this measure.

",Effective Clinical Care,"Patients for whom selected blood conservation strategies were used. 
 Numerator Scoring: Each blood conservation strategy of this measure accounts for 25% of the total composite score. Each of the four blood conservation strategies must be reported to be included in the performance measurement. The total composite score will be calculated by the data source and not the individual practitioner. 
 1. Use of Lysine analogues 
 Numerator Note: As indicated by Intraoperative Antifibrinolytic med: Aminocaproic Acid or Tranexamic Acid. 
 2. Use of mini-circuits or Retrograde Autologous Priming (RAP) or Ultrafiltration (Minimize hemodilution caused by cardiopulmonary bypass pump priming solution) 
 Numerator Note: Record the usage of retrograde autologous priming or a miniaturized circuit volume by the cardiopulmonary perfusion team prior to the onset of cardiopulmonary bypass. 
 Numerator Note: Capture the total volume of ultrafiltrate removed by the cardiopulmonary perfusion team during cardiopulmonary bypass and during modified ultra-hemofiltration post-CPB. Record the data in milliliters. 
 3. Use of red cell salvage using centrifugation 
Numerator Note: Capture the volume of cell saver collected and given. Do not include autologous, allogeneic, pump-residual, or chest-tube recirculated blood. 
 4. Use of transfusion algorithm supplemented with point-of-care testing 
 Numerator Note: Transfusion algorithm includes SCA/STS guideline recommendations or an evidence-based algorithm formulated at the local level. 
 Composite Performance Score 
 Performance Score Note: This performance score is calculated by the data source and not the individual practitioner. Eligible clinicians reporting this measure must submit numerator quality codes for each of the four blood conservation strategies identified in this measure. The performance score is the cumulative sum of performance met for each blood conservation strategy listed in the numerator of this measure. 

 For example, for a single patient encounter, if the eligible clinician reports performance met coding for “Use of mini-circuits or RAP or Ultrafiltration”, “Use of red cell salvage using centrifugation”, and “Use of transfusion algorithm supplemented with point-of-care testing” and performance not met for “Use of lysine analogues”, the cumulative score would be calculated as 3 performance met divided by 4 possibilities of performance met that would equal 75%. This eligible clinician for this particular patient would be assessed as “Performance Not Met” because the eligible clinician had a cumulative score less than 100%.

Definition: Practices and eligible clinicians may customize their patient experience and satisfaction with anesthesia surveys to meet local needs but, at a minimum, surveys must include a core set of questions that address three of the four following criteria related to patient experience and satisfaction and one mandatory question described below. 
1.Pre-operative Education and Preparation
2.Patient and/or Family Communication
3.Care Team Response to Comfort and Well-Being
4.Post-operative pain control and/or management

Mandatory question that must be included in each survey (practices should also include an option for patient to indicate “Not Applicable”): 
1.On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the worst anesthesia experience and where 5 indicates the best anesthesia experience, how would you rate your overall anesthesia experience?

Numerator Note: Practices and individual eligible clinicians who have contracted with or receive patient experience and satisfaction with anesthesia services via the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Outpatient and Ambulatory Surgery Survey (OAS CAHPS®), CAHPS® Surgical Care Survey or other CAHPS survey fulfill the spirit of this measure and should report Performance Met for patients who received such surveys.

Numerator Note:Practices and eligible clinicians may wish to supplement these questions by taking into consideration the recommendations of the ASA Committee on Performance and Outcomes Measurement work product entitled “Patient Satisfaction and Experience with Anesthesia.”

Numerator Note: Depending on local practice, practices and eligible clinicians may wish to supplement survey questions by taking into consideration the recommendations developed as part of the Perioperative Surgical Home (PSH) that are structured in five distinct components. 1.Pre-Operative Education and Preparation (Four Indicators) 
a. Patient comfort with instructions provided about eating better

Definition: A corneal injury is either a corneal abrasion (a scratch or scrape on the cornea, the clear front window of the eye that transmits and focuses light into the eye) or exposure keratitis (inflammation of the cornea from drying of the corneal tear film). Includes both exposure keratitis and corneal abrasion. For the purposes of this measure, the distinction does not need to be made with fluorescein examination of the cornea under ultraviolet light; however, it can be diagnosed in this manner. Corneal injury also includes any new symptom of eye pain treated with topical antibiotic (e.g., erythromycin) while in the post-anesthesia care unit/recovery area. Other causes of eye pain (e.g. acute angle-closure glaucoma) can be excluded by instilling one drop of local anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine) into the eye. If the pain is immediately and completely relieved, corneal injury is confirmed and acute angle-closure glaucoma is excluded.i

**Anesthesia End (Finish) Time is the time at which the anesthesiologist turns over care of the patient to a post anesthesia care team (either PACU or ICU).  This time ends when the anesthesia team is no longer furnishing anesthesia services to the patient, that is when the patient may be placed safely under postoperative care and when the anesthesia team has completed transfer of patient care.i

",Knee Arthroscopy for Meniscectomy,"The change in a validated knee measure score will be used as a performance measure for surgeons performing knee arthroscopy for meniscectomy. Two measures will be created and reported by each surgeon. Surgeons will report the average knee measure change score for patients treated during the observation period. In addition, surgeons will produce a risk-adjusted knee measure change score ratio by dividing the average patient knee measure change score by the average predicted patient knee measure change score calculated using the formula provided. These measures will serve as sports medicine performance measures at the eligible surgeon level. Eligible validated knee patient reported outcome measures include: International Knee Documental Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form (Pedi-IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) [1]. Defining the population: CPT-4 procedure codes will be used to identify patients who received knee arthroscopy for meniscectomy. Isolated Meniscectomy during the reporting period CPT-4 Codes: 29880, 29881. Excluding concurrent with Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (29888) and other concomitant procedures. Surgeons who performed a minimum of 25 meniscectomy procedures a year will be eligible to submit this measure. Time period for data collection and reporting: This measure will be calculated using all patients who underwent meniscectomy during the observation period. Patients receiving meniscectomy during the period 18 to 6 months prior to the reporting data will be included in the analysis to ensure 6 months of patient-reported follow-up in the knee measure score are available. Measures: Two surgeon-level performance measures will be reported. The unadjusted measure will be the average 6-month knee measure change score across all meniscectomy patients treated by the surgeon. The adjusted measure will be the ratio of the average knee measure change score divided by the average predicted knee measure change score for all patients treated by the surgeon. Unadjusted measure: Average Knee Measure Change Score. NUMERATOR: Sum of knee measure change scores from pre-surgery to 6-months post-surgery across all meniscectomy patients in the denominator. DENOMINATOR: The number of all patients who received meniscectomy during the observation window from the surgeon. Type of score: Validated knee measure change score average. Risk adjusted measure: Knee Measure Change Score Ratio. NUMERATOR: Average 6-month knee measure change score for all meniscectomy patients treated by surgeon. DENOMINATOR: Average predicted 6-month knee measure change score for all meniscectomy patients treated by surgeon. Risk adjustment methods and variables: The predicted 6 month knee measure change scores are estimated for each patient using the Center for Effectiveness Research in Orthopaedics’ (CERortho) risk adjustment regression model that includes the following patient variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, history or prior knee surgery, sport participation/activity level, osteoarthritis, concomitant chondral injury, the baseline knee measure, and baseline measures of pain, knee function, and quality of life.[2-4]. Variables included in the current CERortho risk model are based on information in available databases. CERortho plans to constantly update these specified variables based on input from evaluated surgeons and specialty organizations. Appendix A contains the list of baseline concepts from peer-reviewed literature that are thought to affect outcomes of treatment and will be candidates for future inclusion in the model. Type of score: Ratio score; Interpretation of score: Surgeons with ratio scores equal to 1 have quality scores equal to the average surgeon given the characteristics of their patients. Surgeons with ratio scores greater than 1 had knee change scores higher than average. Surgeons with ratios scores less than 1 had knee change scores lower than average given the characteristics of their patients. Definitions: Patient’s Knee Measure Score: A knee measure score is produced when the patient answers a validated knee assessment administered in the clinic or through an online portal. Patient’s Knee Measure Change Score: A patient’s change score is calculated by subtracting the patient’s knee measure score at baseline from the patient’s knee measure score at 6 months. Patient’s Knee Measure Predicted Adjusted Change Score: Knee measure change scores for patients are risk adjusted using a regression model that includes the following independent variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, history or prior knee surgery, sport participation/activity level, osteoarthritis, concomitant chondral injury, the baseline knee measure, and baseline measures of pain, knee function, and quality of life.[2-4] The patient’s predicted knee measure change score is the dependent variable. The regression model produces a risk-adjusted predicted knee measure change score for each patient. Risk-adjusted Knee Measure Change Score Ratio: The ratio between the actual change scores and the predicted change scores (after risk adjustment) is the ratio score. The risk-adjusted knee measure change score represents risk-adjusted change corrected for patient characteristics. A risk-adjusted ratio score of one or greater should be interpreted as change scores that were as good as or better than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. Risk-adjusted ratio change scores less than one should be interpreted as knee measure change scores that were less than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. The surgeon ratio scores can be used to make comparisons across surgeons. Steps: 1. Prior to meniscectomy surgery the patient completes a baseline validated knee measure assessment which generates the patient’s knee measure score at baseline; 2. Six months after surgery, the patient completes the same validated knee measure assessment again, which generates the patient’s knee measure score at 6 months; 3. The patient’s raw, unadjusted knee measure change score is generated by subtracting the baseline score from the 6-month score; Unadjusted measure: 4. Patients’ knee measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. Adjusted measure:  5. A risk-adjusted knee measure change score is predicted using the CERortho risk-adjustment regression model. 6.

5657468,Hawkins Foundation,HF5,Shoulder Arthroplasty: Change in a Validated Shoulder Patient Reported Outcome Measure Following Shoulder Arthroplasty,"The change in a validated shoulder measure score will be used as a performance measure for surgeons performing shoulder arthroplasty which includes hemiarthroplasty, total anatomical and reverse arthroplasty procedures. Two measures will be created and reported by each surgeon. Surgeons will report the average shoulder measure change score for patients treated during the observation period. In addition, surgeons will produce a risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score ratio by dividing the average patient shoulder measure change score by the average predicted patient shoulder measure change score calculated using the formula provided. These measures will serve as sports medicine performance measures at the eligible surgeon level. Eligible validated shoulder patient reported outcome measures include: American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) [1] Defining the population: CPT-4 codes will be used to identify patients who received shoulder arthroplasty surgery. Shoulder arthroplasty during the reporting period CPT-4 Codes: 23470, 23472 (excluding 23 473 and 23474). Surgeons who performed a minimum of 25 shoulder arthroplasty procedures a year will be eligible to submit this measure. Time period for data collection and reporting: This measure will be calculated using all patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty during the observation period. Patients receiving shoulder arthroplasty during the period 18 to 6 months prior to the reporting data will be included in the analysis to ensure 6 months of patient-reported follow-up in the shoulder measure score are available. Measures: Two surgeon-level performance measures will be reported. The unadjusted measure will be the average 6-month shoulder measure change score across all shoulder arthroplasty patients treated by the surgeon. The adjusted measure will be the ratio of the average shoulder measure change score divided by the average predicted shoulder measure change score for all patients treated by the surgeon. Unadjusted measure: Average Shoulder Measure Change Score NUMERATOR: Sum of shoulder measure change scores from pre-surgery to 6-months post-surgery across all shoulder arthroplasty patients in the denominator.

DENOMINATOR: Average predicted 6-month shoulder measure change score for all shoulder arthroplasty patients treated by surgeon. Risk adjustment methods and variables: The predicted 6-month shoulder measure change scores are estimated for each patient using the Center for Effectiveness Research in Orthopaedics’ (CERortho) risk adjustment regression model that includes the following patient variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, prior shoulder surgery, fracture, glenoid type, arthroplasty type (reverse vs. traditional total, hemi), the baseline shoulder measure, and baseline measures of pain, shoulder function, and quality of life.[2-6] Variables included in the current CERortho risk model are based on information in available databases. CERortho plans to constantly update these specified variables based on input from evaluated surgeons and specialty organizations. Appendix A contains the list of baseline concepts from peer-reviewed literature that are thought to affect outcomes of treatment and will be candidates for future inclusion in the model. Type of score: Ratio score Interpretation of score: Surgeons with ratio scores equal to 1 have quality scores equal to the average surgeon given the characteristics of their patients. Surgeons with ratio scores greater than 1 had shoulder change scores higher than average. Surgeons with ratios scores less than 1 had shoulder change scores lower than average given the characteristics of their patients. Definitions: Patient’s Shoulder Measure Score: A shoulder measure score is produced when the patient answers a validated shoulder assessment administered in the clinic or through an online portal. Patient’s Shoulder Measure Change Score: A patient’s change score is calculated by subtracting the patient’s shoulder measure score at baseline from the patient’s shoulder measure score at 6 months. Patient’s Shoulder Measure Predicted Adjusted Change Score: Shoulder measure change scores for patients are risk adjusted using a regression model that includes the following independent variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, prior shoulder surgery, fracture, glenoid type, arthroplasty type (reverse vs. traditional total, hemi), the baseline shoulder measure, and baseline measures of pain, shoulder function, and quality of life.[2-6] The patient’s predicted shoulder measure change score is the dependent variable. The regression model produces a risk-adjusted predicted shoulder measure change score for each patient. Risk-adjusted Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio: The ratio between the actual change scores and the predicted change scores (after risk adjustment) is the ratio score. The risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score represents risk-adjusted change corrected for patient characteristics. A risk-adjusted ratio score of one or greater should be interpreted as change scores that were as good as or better than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. Risk-adjusted ratio change scores less than one should be interpreted as shoulder measure change scores that were less than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. The surgeon ratio scores can be used to make comparisons across surgeons. Steps: 1. Prior to shoulder arthroplasty surgery the patient completes a baseline validated shoulder measure assessment which generates the patient’s shoulder measure score at baseline. 2. Six months after surgery, the patient completes the same validated shoulder measure assessment again, which generates the patient’s shoulder measure score at 6 months. 3. The patient’s raw, unadjusted shoulder measure change score is generated by subtracting the baseline score from the 6-month score. Unadjusted measure: 4. Patients’ shoulder measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. Adjusted measure: 5.

 b. If functionality 5 or less and/or pain 7 or more, medical record documentation of treatment change or diagnostic work up is present. 
 c. Failure to document these changes with continued treatment despite lessening functionality and/or increasing pain would result in measure failure. 

 Measure explanation: 
 a.

Pain scale maintained between 4-6 for good control with current treatment regimen and/or a two-point improvement in pain since last visit for treatment with or without treatment adjustments. If this fails to occur provider changes technique or considers other intervention (i.e.: further diagnostics, referral, injections, prescription medication). 
 b. If provider changes manipulative technique at the previous visit he/she uses QVAS at the subsequent visit to assess impact of change in technique or intervention on current pain state where patient’s pain is above a 6 on a 0-10 scale with 0 being no pain and 10 greatest pain and/or functionality is < 6 on a 0- 10 scale with 10 most and 0 least functional.

4191207,Maine Osteopathic Association in Collaboration with Patient 360,MOA 14,Addressing anxiety in pain patients with SNRI and SSRIs and reducing/eliminating benzodiazepines for chronic anxiety.,"Successful Reporting: Chronic pain patients with anxiety symptoms will be provided an SNRI/SSRI prescription and not acutely given benzodiazepines as documented in the medical record and medication list. Patients with chronic pain on benzodiazepines will have those drugs serially weaned and replaced by SNRI/SSRI agents unless a defined anxiety syndrome exists, is documented by a psychiatric provider and this comorbid state is verified. 

 Measure explanation: Benzodiazepines are implicated in polypharmacy overdose deaths and are often prescribed for sleep or anxiety symptoms. Pain patients typically have deficits in serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) secondary to pain chronicity and physiologic response. NE and 5-HT block pain in the ascending spine and deficiencies are associated with increased pain and the primary presenting symptom of 5- HT deficiency is anxiety. As such, appropriate management warrants utilization of SNRI/SSRI agents in this setting in lieu of benzodiazepines.

If functionality 5 or less and/or pain 7 or more, medical record documentation of treatment change or diagnostic work up is present. Failure to document these changes with continued treatment despite lessening functionality and/or increasing pain would result in measure failure. 

Providers would be providing manual medicine in addition to non-traditional, but literature proven alternative medicine modalities (i.e.: acupuncture) with patients who have imaging confirmed spinal stenosis (M99 ICD-10 Code). 

Measure explanation: Spinal stenosis typically is conservatively managed until surgical fusion or foraminotomy is necessitated based upon pain or neuropathic progression necessitating spinal fusion and/or foraminotomy. These surgeries carry risk to the patient and major expense to the system. Moreover, once a spinal fusion occurs, typically the areas above and/or below this area are fused in another 5-10 years. Avoiding the initial surgery is the only means to avoid subsequent surgeries and the associated risks and costs.

Performance Measure #2 - The overall percentage of patients that improve their general health scores beyond a minimum threshold for each postoperative interval.
 
Instructions: Patients who undergo a surgical procedure are asked to complete a general health outcomes survey both preoperatively and following surgery. 

Rationale: Understanding a patient’s mental and general physical improvement as a result of surgery is an important aspect of clinical care. The general health scores that are calculated can be used to improve a specific patient’s care plan or can be analyzed retrospectively to modify overall treatment methodologies. In addition, general health scores can be used to risk adjust other, surgery specific outcomes scores that are collected. Doctors have the option of collecting a postoperative general health survey at different intervals following surgery to account for different surgery types and physician follow-up patterns.

Definition: A corneal injury is either a corneal abrasion (a scratch or scrape on the cornea, the clear front window of the eye that transmits and focuses light into the eye) or exposure keratitis (inflammation of the cornea from drying of the corneal tear film). Includes both exposure keratitis and corneal abrasion. For the purposes of this measure, the distinction does not need to be made with fluorescein examination of the cornea under ultraviolet light; however, it can be diagnosed in this manner. Corneal injury also includes any new symptom of eye pain treated with topical antibiotic (e.g., erythromycin) while in the post-anesthesia care unit/recovery area. Other causes of eye pain (e.g. acute angle-closure glaucoma) can be excluded by instilling one drop of local anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine) into the eye. If the pain is immediately and completely relieved, corneal injury is confirmed and acute angle-closure glaucoma is excluded.i

** Anesthesia End (Finish) Time is the time at which the anesthesiologist turns over care of the patient to a post anesthesia care team (either PACU or ICU). This time ends when the anesthesia team is no longer furnishing anesthesia services to the patient, that is when the patient may be placed safely under postoperative care and when the anesthesia team has completed transfer of patient care.i

",Person and Caregiver-Centered Experience and Outcomes,"Patients who received a survey within 30 days of the procedure to assess their experience and satisfaction with anesthesia. 

 Definition: Practices and eligible clinicians may customize their patient experience and satisfaction with anesthesia surveys to meet local needs but, at a minimum, surveys must include a core set of questions that address three of the four following criteria related to patient experience and satisfaction and one mandatory question described below. 
 1. Pre-operative Education and Preparation 
 2. Patient and/or Family Communication 
 3. Care Team Response to Comfort and Well-Being 
 4. Post-operative pain control and/or management 

 Mandatory question that must be included in each survey (practices should also include an option for patient to indicate “Not Applicable”): 
1. On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the worst anesthesia experience and where 5 indicates the best anesthesia experience, how would you rate your overall anesthesia experience? 

 Numerator Note: Practices and individual eligible clinicians who have contracted with or receive patient experience and satisfaction with anesthesia services via the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Outpatient and Ambulatory Surgery Survey (OAS CAHPS®), CAHPS® Surgical Care Survey or other CAHPS survey fulfill the spirit of this measure and should report Performance Met for patients who received such surveys. 

 Numerator Note: Practices and eligible clinicians may wish to supplement these questions by taking into consideration the recommendations of the ASA Committee on Performance and Outcomes Measurement work product entitled “Patient Satisfaction and Experience with Anesthesia.” 

Numerator Note: Depending on local practice, practices and eligible clinicians may wish to supplement survey questions by taking into consideration the recommendations developed as part of the Perioperative Surgical Home (PSH) that are structured in five distinct components.

",Person and Caregiver-Centered Experience and Outcomes,"Patients who undergo anesthesia care and who do not have a new diagnosis of corneal injury prior to anesthesia end time**.

Definition: A corneal injury is either a corneal abrasion (a scratch or scrape on the cornea, the clear front window of the eye that transmits and focuses light into the eye) or exposure keratitis (inflammation of the cornea from drying of the corneal tear film). Includes both exposure keratitis and corneal abrasion. For the purposes of this measure, the distinction does not need to be made with fluorescein examination of the cornea under ultraviolet light; however, it can be diagnosed in this manner. Corneal injury also includes any new symptom of eye pain treated with topical antibiotic (e.g., erythromycin) while in the post-anesthesia care unit/recovery area. Other causes of eye pain (e.g. acute angle-closure glaucoma) can be excluded by instilling one drop of local anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine) into the eye. If the pain is immediately and completely relieved, corneal injury is confirmed and acute angle-closure glaucoma is excluded.i

Definition: A corneal injury is either a corneal abrasion (a scratch or scrape on the cornea, the clear front window of the eye that transmits and focuses light into the eye) or exposure keratitis (inflammation of the cornea from drying of the corneal tear film). Includes both exposure keratitis and corneal abrasion. For the purposes of this measure, the distinction does not need to be made with fluorescein examination of the cornea under ultraviolet light; however, it can be diagnosed in this manner. Corneal injury also includes any new symptom of eye pain treated with topical antibiotic (e.g., erythromycin) while in the post-anesthesia care unit/recovery area.
