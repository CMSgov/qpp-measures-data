IA,IA_AHE_12,Practice Improvements that Engage Community Resources to Address Drivers of Health,"Select and screen for drivers of health that are relevant for the eligible clinician’s population using evidence-based tools. If possible, use a screening tool that is health IT-enabled and includes standards-based, coded questions/fields for the capture of data. After screening, address identified drivers of health through at least one of the following:
• Develop and maintain formal relationships with community-based organizations to strengthen the community service referral process, implementing closed-loop referrals where feasible; or 
• Work with community partners to provide and/or update a community resource guide for to patients who are found to have and/or be at risk in one or more areas of drivers of health; or
• Record findings of screening and follow up within the electronic health record (EHR); identify screened patients with one or more needs associated with drivers of health and implement approaches to better serve their holistic needs through meaningful linkages to community resources. 

Drivers of health (also referred to as social determinants of health [SDOH] or health-related social needs [HSRN]) prioritized by the practice might include, but are not limited to, the following: food security; housing stability; transportation accessibility; interpersonal safety; legal challenges; and environmental exposures.

• Use of standard questionnaires for assessing improvements in health disparities related to functional health status (for example, use of Seattle Angina Questionnaire, MD Anderson Symptom Inventory, and/or SF-12/VR-12 functional health status assessment);
• Use of standardized processes for screening for drivers of health, such as food security, housing stability, and transportation accessibility;
• Generation and use of regular feedback reports that summarize local practice patterns and treatment outcomes, including for populations that are disadvantaged and/or underserved by the healthcare system;
• Use of processes and tools that engage patients to improve adherence to treatment plans;
• Implementation of patient self-action plans;
• Implementation of shared clinical decision-making capabilities;
• Use of QCDR patient experience data to inform and advance improvements in beneficiary engagement;
• Promotion of collaborative learning network opportunities that are interactive;
• Use of supporting QCDR modules that can be incorporated into the certified EHR technology; or
