QCDR,,,,,ABFM12,,,"This is a measure evaluating primary care physicians (PCPs); for each PCP, the denominator is all patients seen during the evaluation period who had at least 2 PCP visits. The numerator is the number of those patients whose Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index is >= 0.7. The Bice-Boxerman index is a validated measure of patient-level care continuity that ranges from 0 to 1; 0 reflects completely disjointed care and 1 reflects complete continuity with the same PCP for all visits. The Bice-Boxerman index was used in a previously NQF endorsed measure for children with medical complexity. Compared to lower scores (e.g., 0.6 or lower), continuity index scores of 0.7 or higher have been associated with significantly lower Medicare expenditures and significantly lower odds of hospitalization.1
