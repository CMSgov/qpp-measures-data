IA,IA_PM_24,Implementation of Protocols and Provision of Resources to Increase Lung Cancer Screening Uptake,"Establish a process or procedure to increase rates of lung cancer screening through one or more of the following interventions:
•Implementation of protocols that support enhanced documentation methods to identify eligible patients for lung cancer screening. 
++ Example: A practice could embed electronic health record (EHR) prompts to flag insufficient patient smoking history (for example, total pack-years) and increase practice awareness around patient eligibility for screening
++ Example: A practice could implement documentation processes or procedures (for example, retrospective chart review, lung cancer screening eligibility questionnaire) to improve patient lung cancer screening eligibility data in the medical record
•Development of a patient outreach and activation plan consisting of educational materials and resources for patients at high-risk of lung cancer for improved patient engagement and decision-making. 
++ Example: Providers or clinic staff could provide culturally and linguistically appropriate patient-directed educational or care navigation materials related to lung cancer screening, eligibility criteria for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), and the purpose and benefits of screening
++ Example: Providers or clinic staff could provide tools to prepare patients for shared decision-making (SDM) clinical encounters and promote patient/provider communication on lung cancer screening decision-making
•Establishment of a navigation program to improve uptake and adherence of lung cancer screening and increase rates of LDCT referral completion. 
++ Example: A practice could designate and train existing clinic staff or hire an additional staff member to counsel patients on the importance of lung cancer screening and refer them to existing resources (for example, transportation assistance, translator, financial services, appointment scheduling) to support ability to obtain LDCT
++ Example: A practice could create a process to follow up with referred patients via telephone reminders or virtual notifications (for example, email, patient charts)",2025,,NULL,Population Management
IA,IA_PM_25,Save a Million Hearts: Standardization of Approach to Screening and Treatment for Cardiovascular Disease Risk,"Implement standardized, evidence-based cardiovascular disease risk assessment and care management for a defined population in the clinician’s practice.
The clinician or clinician group will apply standardized risk assessment and care management to a broad, clinician-defined patient population in the practice. The population can be defined by 1) patient age and/or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors; or 2) the constraints of the risk assessment tool (for example, the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) ASCVD Risk Calculator is validated for patients over age 40).
The results of screening and the plan for treatment and follow up will be documented using a standardized method in the patient’s medical record. Care management plan and follow up intervals will be influenced by the degree of patient risk.
Cardiovascular care management should be defined by risk assessment and lead to the development of individualized care plans with specific goals. Shared decision making should be part of the development of every patient care plan.

IA,IA_PM_26,"Vaccine Achievement for Practice Staff: COVID-19, Influenza, and Hepatitis B","Demonstrate that the MIPS eligible clinician’s practice has achieved and/or maintained a vaccination rate of 60 percent of clinical practice staff for COVID-19, and 80 percent for influenza. Demonstrate vaccination, immunity, or non-responder status to hepatitis B for 95 percent of clinical practice staff. Vaccination recommendations are from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; staff with contraindications to the vaccinations, as determined by the CDC, are excluded from the requirements.
