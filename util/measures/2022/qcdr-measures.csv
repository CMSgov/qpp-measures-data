4849508,ABFM PRIME,ABFM12,New,Measuring the Value-Functions of Primary Care: Physician Level Continuity of Care Measure,"This is a measure evaluating primary care physicians (PCPs); for each PCP, the denominator is all patients seen during the evaluation period who had at least 2 PCP visits. The numerator is the number of those patients whose Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index is >= 0.7. The Bice-Boxerman index is a validated measure of patient-level care continuity that ranges from 0 to 1; 0 reflects completely disjointed care and 1 reflects complete continuity with the same PCP for all visits. (The Bice-Boxerman index was used in a previously primary care NQF endorsed measure for children with medical complexity.) Compared to lower scores (e.g., 0.6 or lower), continuity index scores of 0.7 or higher have been associated with significantly lower Medicare expenditures and significantly lower odds of hospitalization.

6853338,U.S. Wound Registry,USWR31,New,Pressure Ulcer* (PU) Healing or Closure (not on the lower extremity ),"Percentage of Stage 2, 3, or 4 pressure ulcers* (not on the lower extremity) among patients aged 18 or older that achieve healing or closure within 6 months, stratified by the Wound Healing Index (WHI). Healing or closure may occur by delayed secondary intention or may be the result of surgical intervention (e.g., rotational flap or skin graft). Lower extremity pressure ulcers are not included in this measure because they commonly overlap with arterial and diabetic foot ulcers and require a separate risk stratification model. [Note: The National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIA) (formerly the NPUAP) has renamed pressure ulcers “pressure injuries,” but the ICD-10-CM continues to use the term pressure “ulcers”. This measure is limited to open defects (stages 2, 3, 4) which heal by secondary intention or surgical closure, typically referred to as ulcers.]",N/A,Person and Caregiver Centered Experience and Outcomes,Yes,Outcome,No,Yes,No,No,4,"There are four rates reported for this measure. Three of the rates will be risk stratified into risk categories using the Wound Healing Index for pressure ulcers (non-heel) which roughly represent: 
Rate 1: pressure ulcers likely to heal with conservative care, 
Rate 2: pressure ulcers which may or may not heal, 
Rate 3: pressure ulcers which are unlikely to heal. The average of the three risk stratified buckets which will be the performance rate in the XML submitted.
