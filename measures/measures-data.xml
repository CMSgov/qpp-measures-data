    <description>Empanel (assign responsibility for) the total population, linking each patient to a MIPS eligible clinician or group or care team.

Empanelment is a series of processes that assign each active patient to a MIPS eligible clinician or group and/or care team, confirm assignment with patients and clinicians, and use the resultant patient panels as a foundation for individual patient and population health management. 

Empanelment identifies the patients and population for whom the MIPS eligible clinician or group and/or care team is responsible and is the foundation for the relationship continuity between patient and MIPS eligible clinician or group /care team that is at the heart of comprehensive primary care. Effective empanelment requires identification of the "active population" of the practice: those patients who identify and use your practice as a source for primary care. There are many ways to define "active patients" operationally, but generally, the definition of "active patients" includes patients who have sought care within the last 24 to 36 months, allowing inclusion of younger patients who have minimal acute or preventive health care.</description>

This includes the provision of all necessary information to the patient that will allow the patient to enroll in an outpatient CR program. This also includes a written or electronic communication between the healthcare provider or healthcare system and the cardiac rehabilitation program that includes the patient's enrollment information for the program. A hospital discharge summary or office note may potentially be formatted to include the necessary patient information to communicate to the CR program (the patient’s cardiovascular history, testing, and treatments, for instance). According to standards of practice for cardiac rehabilitation programs, care coordination communications are sent to the referring provider, including any issues regarding treatment changes, adverse treatment responses, or new non-emergency condition (new symptoms, patient care questions, etc.) that need attention by the referring provider. These communications also include a progress report once the patient has completed the program. All communications must maintain an appropriate level of confidentiality as outlined by the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Note: A patient with a qualifying diagnosis should have a referral to CR within the subsequent 12 months. In the event that the patient has a second (recurrent) qualifying event before the original 12 month “referral” period has ended, a new 12 month “referral” period for CR referral starts at the time of the second qualifying event, since the patient again becomes eligible for CR at that time.</description>
