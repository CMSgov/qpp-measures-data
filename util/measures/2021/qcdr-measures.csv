ABFM PRIME,ABFM11,Person-Centered Primary Care Measure Performance Measure (PCPCM PRO-PM),"The Person-Centered Primary Care Measure Performance Measure (PCPCM PRO-PM) utilizes the PCPCM PROM (a comprehensive and parsimonious set of 11 patient-reported items) to assess the broad scope of primary care: accessibility; comprehensive, whole person focus; integration of care across acute and chronic illness, prevention, mental health, and life events; coordinating care in a fragmented system; knowing the patient as a person; developing a relationship through key life events; advocacy; providing care in a family context; providing care in a community context; goal-oriented care; and, disease, illness, and prevention management. The PCPCM PRO-PM performance measure, generated from the patient reported instrument, goes beyond usual patient experience or satisfaction measures, to use the on-the-ground view of patients to assess elements of primary care missed by usual measures and gives clinicians a distinctive and comprehensive view from a patient’s perspective.

Calculation method: Individual item scores reported as average of patient responses on 1-4 scale. Summary score is sum of individual item scores divided by the number of items answered and translated into a percentage. If fewer than 8 items are answered, omit this patient’s responses from PCPCM-PM calculation. The PCPCM PRO-PM performance score can be calculated at the clinician or practice level. There is no stratification required with the PCPCM. 

Scoring Details: Scoring for the PCPCM PRO-PM is completed through a simple 4 step process using the PCPCM PRO gathered data. 
Step One: Any PCPCM PRO instrument for which a patient failed to answer at least 8 of the 11 items is not part of the denominator and should not be included in the calculation.

Step Two: Calculate item specific mean score. Each response item is assigned a value: Definitely = 4, Mostly = 3, Somewhat = 2, Not At All = 1. The score for each PCPCM PRO item is calculated as a mean, i.e., the summary of all responses received for an item, divided by the number of respondents. This process leads to 11 item specific PRO scores. Means should be reported to two decimal points.

Step Three: Calculate the PCPCM PRO total score. The PCPCM PRO total score is calculated by determining the mean of the 11 scored PRO items. This is done by adding the mean scores of all 11 PRO items and then dividing by 11. PRO means should be reported to two decimal points.

Step Four: Aggregate PCPCM PRO total scores and convert to PCPCM PRO-PM performance score. The PCPCM PRO-PM can be used at both the individual clinician and the group practice level. For this step:
•	Identify the entity to be measured and aggregate all PCPCM PRO total scores for that entity during the performance period. Divide the total by the number of PCPCM PRO total scores used in order to determine the mean PCPCM PRO total score for the measured entity.
•	Convert the 4-point PRO total score to the PRO-PM performance score by dividing by 4 and then multiplying by 100. Thus, a PCPCM PRO total score of 2.78 (based on a scale of 1-4) becomes a PCPCM PRO-PM performance score of 69.5 (on a scale of 0-100). 

PCPCM PRO total scores can be calculated for short term periods to inform quality improvement and to provide mid-performance period feedback to clinicians and practices. PCPCM PRO-PM performance scores are calculated based on quality reporting program requirements or a 12-month time frame.

The PCPCM PRO-PM performance score can be calculated at the clinician or practice level.

There is no stratification required with the PCPCM.",Traditional MIPS
ABFM PRIME,ABFM9,Measuring the Value-Functions of Primary Care: Provider Level Continuity Measure,"Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Primary Care Physician Measure. 

At a patient-level, Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Primary Care Physician Measure is a measure that considers the dispersion of primary care visits across providers, such that patients with higher scores have most of their primary care visits to the same provider or a small number of providers while those lower scores see a larger number providers. Formally, an individual Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care score is calculated as follows:

Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care =(∑_(i=1)^k n_i^2 -N)/(N(N-1)) (1)

where k is the number of providers, n_i is the number of visits to provider i, and N is the total number of visits. (Note that it is necessary that the patient has at least two visits.)
We will calculate the physician-level continuity measure for all patients as follows: 
 
Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care-PC=(∑_1^k 〖((Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care)(n_k ))〗)/(N*(n_k)) (2)

Where Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care is the individual patient continuity score, n is number of total primary care visits for patient k during the study period, and N is the total number of patients seen by the physicians during the study period. This approach gives greater weight to patients with more visits.",N/A,Communication and Care Coordination,Yes,Efficiency and Cost/Resource Use,No,Yes,No,No,1,1st Performance Rate,No,ABFM PRIME,2020,"Result is the physician-level continuity index score, zero equals no continuity and 100 equals total patient continuity.",Traditional MIPS

Rate 1: No evidence of arterial disease and ischemia is not a contributor to non-healing
Rate 2: Possible arterial compromise (possible reduced flow), but the patient may still be able to heal the wound(s) or ulcer(s)
Rate 3: 	Evidence of arterial disease- patient should be referred to specialist for vascular assessment if not currently in the care of a vascular expert. Ischemia may be the reason the patient has failed to heal.
Rate 4: 	The average of the three risk stratified buckets which will be the performance rate in the JSON XML submitted.",Traditional MIPS
