Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way).  Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient’s status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

Formally, an individual Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care score is calculated as follows:\n\nBice-Boxerman Continuity of Care =(∑_(i=1)^k n_i^2 -N)/(N(N-1)) (1)\n\nwhere k is the number of providers, n_i is the number of visits to provider i, and N is the total number of visits. (Note that it is necessary that the patient has at least two visits.)\nWe will calculate the physician-level continuity measure for all patients as follows: \n \nBice-Boxerman Continuity of Care-PC=(∑_1^k 〖((Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care)(n_k ))〗)/(N*(n_k)) (2)\n\nWhere Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care is the individual patient continuity score, n is number of total primary care visits for patient k during the study period, and N is the total number of patients seen by the physicians during the study period.

    "description": "This is a patient-reported outcome performance measure (PRO-PM) consisting of a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) of risk-adjusted change in functional status (FS) for patients aged 14 years+ with lymphedema or other causes of regional swelling. For patients with such conditions affecting the leg, foot, groin, or lower trunk regions, the change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Lower Extremity Regional Swelling (LERS) FS PROM. For patients with such conditions affecting the arm, hand, chest, or breast body regions, the change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Upper Extremity Regional Swelling (UERS) FS PROM. In order to fairly measure performance between providers, the measure is adjusted to patient characteristics known to be associated with FS outcomes (risk adjusted) and used as a performance measure (PM) at the patient level, individual clinician level, and clinic level to assess quality.
