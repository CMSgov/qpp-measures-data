Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way). Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient’s status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

The numerator is the number of those patients whose Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index is >= 0.7. The Bice-Boxerman index is a validated measure of patient-level care continuity that ranges from 0 to 1; 0 reflects completely disjointed care and 1 reflects complete continuity with the same PCP for all visits. (The Bice-Boxerman index was used in a previously primary care NQF endorsed measure for children with medical complexity.) Compared to lower scores (e.g., 0.6 or lower), continuity index scores of 0.7 or higher have been associated with significantly lower Medicare expenditures and significantly lower odds of hospitalization.\nReferences: \n1.

The change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Dizziness Impact Positional (DIP) or Functional (DIF) PROM; these are item-response theory-based measures developed using items from the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, scored using the T-score metric (mean=50, SD=10), with higher scores representing higher dizziness impact (worse functional status). Modern measurement methods, using IRT, did not support use of one overall score for all 25 items from the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) due to not meeting the assumption of unidimensionality, which is an important psychometric limitation. IRT testing supported a positional domain as a separate and distinct construct for positional impacts of dizziness pertaining to changes in head position such as turning over in bed, looking up, or quick movements of the head whereas functional activities loaded on a separate domain. The DIP will be administered for patients with a DIP T-score of 45 or higher whereas the DIF will be administered for patients with a DIP T-score of less than 45 at initial evaluation.
