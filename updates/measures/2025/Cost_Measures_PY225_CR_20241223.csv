cost,Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) episode-based cost measure,"Episode-based cost measures represent the cost to Medicare for the items and services provided to a patient during an episode of care (“episode”). In all supplemental documentation, the term “cost” generally means the standardized Medicare allowed amount, and claims data from Medicare Parts A, B, and D are used to construct this episode-based cost measure.
The CKD episode-based cost measure evaluates a clinician’s or clinician group’s risk-adjusted and specialty-adjusted cost to Medicare for patients who receive medical care to manage and treat stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease. This chronic condition measure includes the costs of services that are clinically related to the attributed clinician’s role in managing care during a CKD episode.",COST_CKD_1,costScore,2025,,TRUE,simpleAverage,administrativeClaims
