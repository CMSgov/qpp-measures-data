This measure will be reported as the overall number of patients of rate 1 and rate 2 combined. To qualify, the patient must complete a baseline score and then one follow-up or discharge score. 

In order to fairly measure performance between providers, the measure is risk-adjusted based on age, sex, symptom characteristics, PROMIS baseline scores, social determinants of health, and psychosocial metrics. 

This measure will include three rates:
1) The number of non-surgical patients achieving a score change greater than or equal to the MCID in PROMIS Physical Function or like mapped measure.
2) The number of surgical patients achieving a  score change greater than or equal to the MCID in PROMIS Physical Function or like mapped measure.
