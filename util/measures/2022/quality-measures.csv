MIPS eligible clinicians do not need to submit any additional documentation or resubmit rejected claims. 

In July of 2019, the American Medical Association (AMA) issued an update to the CPT Category II codes in the CPT 2020 code set, which included the removal of the CPT Category II code 3045F (Most recent hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level 7.0% to 9.0%) effective October 1, 2019.  However, in November of 2019, the AMA issued a revision to the effective date of the CPT Category II code 3045F to reflect an effective date of January 1, 2020.  As a result of stakeholders expressing concerns regarding the initial October 1, 2019 effective date of the code removal and the timing of the notification for the revised effective date occurring after the implementation of the initial effective date, CMS assessed the potential impact that the removal of the CPT Category II code 3045F may have on the submission of claims for Quality ID 001: Diabetes: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Poor Control (>9%) between October 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019.

• Age must be >= to 18 on the outpt visit date. 
• If med reconciliation is reported > once for an inpt discharge (utilizing Part B claims), the most favorable QDC(s) reported w/in 30 days after the discharge should count for the episode for performance calculations.
• The 30 day episode will start 30 days minus the 1st expense date of an outpt visit where a denom code is present on the claim’s line item. If multiple outpt visits appear (where denom codes are on multiple line items) on the same claim take the denom code line item with the latest expense date (of the denom codes that fall within 30-days of the inpt. discharge  on that claim).
•  Hospital (inpt Part B discharge) ""hidden"" codes are at the bene-level regardless of TIN/NPI. Correlate eligible cases with non-denom inpt codes for bene regardless of TIN/NPI to find last inpt expense date, then count 30 days per episode from that date.
• Inpt discharges may occur up to 30 days prior to the beginning of the performance period (January 1, 2019), but outpt visits must occur during the reporting period (January 1 - December 31, 2019).                                                                                                                                                    • Take the last inpt expense date of the line item for the relevant “hidden” inpatient codes when multiple inpt codes are submitted on consecutive days or when one inpt code spans several expense dates, the last date should count as the date of inpt discharge.                                                                                                                                                   
 • The last inpt discharge during the 30 day episode will override any previous inpt discharges. 
• If the outpatient visit occurs during the hospital visit (same day as an inpatient code is submitted), then it will not count as an instance of reporting. An outpatient visit must occur at least one day AFTER an inpatient discharge (break in inpatient codes) to count as an instance of reporting.
