Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way). Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient’s status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

The plan should include a clinic-wide review of existing tools and policies, such as value statements or clinical practice guidelines, to ensure that they include and are aligned with a commitment to anti-racism and an understanding of race as a political and social construct, not a physiological one. The plan should also identify ways in which issues and gaps identified in the review can be addressed and should include target goals and milestones for addressing prioritized issues and gaps. This may also include an assessment and drafting of an organization’s plan to prevent and address racism and/or improve language access and accessibility to ensure services are accessible and understandable for those seeking care. The MIPS eligible clinician or practice can also consider including in their plan ongoing training on anti-racism and/or other processes to support identifying explicit and implicit biases in patient care and addressing historic health inequities experienced by people of color. More information about elements of the CMS Disparities Impact Statement is detailed in the template and action plan document at https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/Agency-Information/OMH/Downloads/Disparities-Impact-Statement-508-rev102018.pdf.",

Data would be submitted to the extent permitted by applicable privacy and security laws. Examples of COVID-19 clinical trials may be found on the U.S. National Library of Medicine website at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19.

For purposes of this improvement activity, clinical data registries must meet the following requirements: (1) the receiving entity must declare that they are ready to accept data as a clinical registry; and (2) be using the data to improve population health outcomes. Most public health agencies and clinical data registries declare readiness to accept data from clinicians via a public online posting. Clinical data registries should make publically available specific information on what data the registry gathers, technical requirements or specifications for how the registry can receive the data, and how the registry may use, re-use, or disclose individually identifiable data it receives.

Such methods may include, but are not limited to, a secure upload function on a web portal, or submission via an intermediary, such as a health information exchange. To ensure interoperability and versatility of the data submitted, any electronic data should be submitted to the clinical data registry using appropriate vocabulary standards for the specific data elements, such as those identified in the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standard adopted in 45 CFR 170.213.",

Examples include recognition for achieving success in measure reporting and/or a high level of effort directed to quality improvement and practice standardization; or\n• Participation in the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) Multi-Specialty Portfolio Program.",

The CDS integrates into the clinical workflow a clinician-facing dashboard to support the clinician’s awareness and adoption of and preventive care for cervical cancer, including screening and any necessary follow-up treatment.\n\nThe CCSM CDS is fully conformant with the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, so it can be used with any certified EHR platform. The CDS Hooks and SMART-on-FHIR interoperability interface standards provide two   ways to integrate with the clinical workflow in a way that complements existing displays and information pre-visit, during visit, and for post-visit follow-up. CCSM CDS helps the clinician evaluate the patient’s clinical data against existing guidance and displays patient-specific recommendations.",

Lower extremity pressure ulcers are not included in this measure because they commonly overlap with arterial and diabetic foot ulcers and require a separate risk stratification model.

This measure is limited to open defects (stages 2, 3, 4) which heal by secondary intention or surgical closure, typically referred to as ulcers.

The numerator is the number of those patients whose Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index is >= 0.7. The Bice-Boxerman index is a validated measure of patient-level care continuity that ranges from 0 to 1; 0 reflects completely disjointed care and 1 reflects complete continuity with the same PCP for all visits. The Bice-Boxerman index was used in a previously NQF endorsed measure for children with medical complexity. Compared to lower scores (e.g., 0.6 or lower), continuity index scores of 0.7 or higher have been associated with significantly lower Medicare expenditures and significantly lower odds of hospitalization.1\nReferences: \n1.

The change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Dizziness Positional Status (DPS) or Dizziness Functional Status (DFS) PROM; these are item-response theory-based PROMs developed using items from the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), scored using the T-score metric (mean=50, SD=10), with higher scores representing better FS. (1 )\nThe DPS and DFS measure separate domains represented within DHI items.  The DPS score will be applied to this quality measure for patients with a statistically derived DPS cut-score (T-score) of 55 or lower; the DFS score will be applied for patients with a DPS T-score of greater than 55 at initial evaluation.  This approach is consistent with clinical and research observations that two types of vestibular impairments, positional- and functional-dominant, have distinctly different clinical presentations and expected outcomes.  \nUsing a single PROM score derived from all 25 DHI items is not recommended due to score validity weaknesses. (2-5 Robust analyses using extensive exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses based on over 28,000 episodes of care determined the DHI items represent multiple domains that are different from those originally hypothesized, (6) thus using a single overall score would pose a threat to validity. However, patient responses to DHI items may be used to directly score the DPS and DFS, thus allowing clinicians greater flexibility of choice of PROM used in routine clinical care without adding to clinician nor patient burden.\nTo fairly measure performance between providers, this quality measure is risk-adjusted to patient characteristics known to be associated with FS outcomes and used as a performance measure at the patient and provider levels to assess quality.",
