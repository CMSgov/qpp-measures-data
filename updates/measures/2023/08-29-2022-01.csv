IA,"RHC, IHS or FQHC quality improvement activities","Participating in a Rural Health Clinic (RHC), Indian Health Service Medium Management (IHS), or Federally Qualified Health Center in ongoing engagement activities that contribute to more formal quality reporting, and that include receiving quality data back for broader quality improvement and benchmarking improvement which will ultimately benefit patients. Participation in Indian Health Service, as an improvement activity, requires MIPS eligible clinicians and groups to deliver care to federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native populations in the U.S. and in the course of that care implement continuous clinical practice improvement including reporting data on quality of services being provided and receiving feedback to make improvements over time.",IA_PM_3,2017,,high,Population Management

IA,Use of Toolsets or Other Resources to Close Health and Health Care Inequities Across Communities (Use of toolset or other resources to close healthcare disparities across communities),"Address inequities in health outcomes by using population health data analysis tools to identify health inequities in the community and practice and assess options for effective and relevant interventions such as Population Health Toolkit or other resources identified by the clinician, practice, or by CMS.

The review should consider how structural inequities, such as racism, are influencing patterns of care and consider changes to acknowledge and address them. Reviews should stratify patient data by demographic characteristics and health related social needs to appropriately identify differences among unique populations and assess the drivers of gaps and disparities and identify interventions appropriate for the needs of the sub-populations.",IA_PM_11,2017,,medium,Population Management
IA,Population empanelment,"Empanel (assign responsibility for) the total population, linking each patient to a MIPS eligible clinician or group or care team.Empanelment is a series of processes that assign each active patient to a MIPS eligible clinician or group and/or care team, confirm assignment with patients and clinicians, and use the resultant patient panels as a foundation for individual patient and population health management. Empanelment identifies the patients and population for whom the MIPS eligible clinician or group and/or care team is responsible and is the foundation for the relationship continuity between patient and MIPS eligible clinician or group /care team that is at the heart of comprehensive primary care. Effective empanelment requires identification of the “active population” of the practice: those patients who identify and use your practice as a source for primary care. There are many ways to define “active patients” operationally, but generally, the definition of “active patients” includes patients who have sought care within the last 24 to 36 months, allowing inclusion of younger patients who have minimal acute or preventive health care.",IA_PM_12,2017,,medium,Population Management

These might include, but are not limited to, the NCQA Diabetes Recognition Program (DRP) and the NCQA Heart/Stroke Recognition Program (HSRP);• Use pre-visit planning, that is, preparations for conversations or actions to propose with patient before an in-office visit to optimize preventive care and team management of patients with chronic conditions;• Use panel support tools, (that is, registry functionality) or other technology that can use clinical data to identify trends or data points in patient records to identify services due;• Use predictive analytical models to predict risk, onset and progression of chronic diseases; and/or• Use reminders and outreach (e.g., phone calls, emails, postcards, patient portals, and community health workers where available) to alert and educate patients about services due; and/or routine medication reconciliation.",IA_PM_13,2017,,medium,Population Management
