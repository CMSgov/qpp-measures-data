In all supplemental documentation, \"cost\" generally means the standardized Medicare allowed amount, and claims data from Medicare Parts A and B are used to construct the episode-based cost measures. The Intracranial Hemorrhage or Cerebral Infarction episode-based cost measure evaluates a clinician's risk-adjusted cost to Medicare for patients who receive inpatient treatment for cerebral infarction or intracranial hemorrhage during the performance period. The measure score is the clinician's risk-adjusted cost for the episode group averaged across all episodes attributed to the clinician. This acute inpatient medical condition measure includes costs of services that are clinically related to the attributed clinician's role in managing care during each episode from the clinical event that opens, or \"triggers,\" the episode through 90 days after the trigger.",

The MIPS eligible clinician may accomplish this by working with other members of their practice (for example, financial counselor or patient navigator) as part of a team-based care approach in which members of the patient care team collaborate to support patient- centered goals. For example, a financial counselor could provide patients with resources with further information or support options, or facilitate a conversation with a patient or caregiver that could address concerns. This activity may occur during diagnosis stage, before treatment, during treatment, and/or during survivorship planning, as appropriate.",

Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way). Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient’s status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",
