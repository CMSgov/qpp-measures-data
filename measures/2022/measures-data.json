Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way). Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient’s status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

Actions in this plan may include, but are not limited to, the following:•\tIncorporate trauma-informed training into new employee orientation •\tOffer annual refreshers and/or trainings for all staff •\tRecommend and supply TIC materials to third party partners, including care management companies and billing services•\tIdentify patients using a screening methodology•\tFlag charts for patients with one or more adverse events that might have caused trauma•\tUse ICD-10 diagnosis codes for adverse events when appropriateTIC is a strengths-based healthcare delivery approach that emphasizes physical, psychological, and emotional safety for both trauma survivors and their providers. Core components of a TIC approach are: awareness of the prevalence of trauma; understanding of the impact of past trauma on services utilization and engagement; and a commitment and plan to incorporate that understanding into training, policy, procedure, and practice.",

For patients with such conditions affecting the leg, foot, groin, or lower trunk regions, the change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Lower Quadrant Edema (LQE) FS PROM. For patients with such conditions affecting the arm, hand, chest, or breast body regions, the change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Upper Quadrant Edema (UQE) FS PROM. PROM scores were scaled to the 0-100 metric, with higher scores representing higher perceived functional status. In order to fairly measure performance between providers, the measure is risk-adjusted to patient characteristics known to be associated with FS outcomes and used as a performance measure (PM) at the patient and provider levels to assess quality.",

The numerator is the number of those patients whose Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index is >= 0.7. The Bice-Boxerman index is a validated measure of patient-level care continuity that ranges from 0 to 1; 0 reflects completely disjointed care and 1 reflects complete continuity with the same PCP for all visits. (The Bice-Boxerman index was used in a previously primary care NQF endorsed measure for children with medical complexity.) Compared to lower scores (e.g., 0.6 or lower), continuity index scores of 0.7 or higher have been associated with significantly lower Medicare expenditures and significantly lower odds of hospitalization.\nReferences: \n1.

The change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Dizziness Impact Positional (DIP) or Functional (DIF) PROM; these are item-response theory-based measures developed using items from the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, scored using the T-score metric (mean=50, SD=10), with higher scores representing higher dizziness impact (worse functional status). Modern measurement methods, using IRT, did not support use of one overall score for all 25 items from the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) due to not meeting the assumption of unidimensionality, which is an important psychometric limitation. IRT testing supported a positional domain as a separate and distinct construct for positional impacts of dizziness pertaining to changes in head position such as turning over in bed, looking up, or quick movements of the head whereas functional activities loaded on a separate domain. The DIP will be administered for patients with a DIP T-score of 45 or higher whereas the DIF will be administered for patients with a DIP T-score of less than 45 at initial evaluation. In order to fairly measure performance between providers, the measure is risk-adjusted to patient characteristics known to be associated with FS outcomes and used as a performance measure (PM) at the patient level and provider levels to assess quality.",

Off-loading is not a simple documentation process but may include performing a procedure such as Total Contact Casting or providing appropriate footwear.\n\nThe location of the diabetic foot ulcer on the foot (e.g., heel/midfoot vs. toes) determines the type of off-loading device that is appropriate, the patient’s risk of falling, the probability of successful off-loading and thus the likelihood of major amputation. The clinician needs to evaluate these factors and then provide the most appropriate off-loading option.",
