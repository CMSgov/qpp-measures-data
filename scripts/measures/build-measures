# 2. use the git history of any necessary import scripts
# 3. revert any changes to directory structures below.

# 0a. Add quality measures to the staging measures-data-quality.json file:
node scripts/measures/$currentPerformanceYear/import-quality-measures.js \
	$quality_csv $quality_strata $quality_measures

# 0b. Add PI (formerly ACI) measures to the staging measures-data-pi.json file:
# (For now it's just copying over 2017's with ACI changed to PI, preAttestation
# changed to attestation, and a few content tweaks by CMS)
cat util/measures/$currentPerformanceYear/pi-measures.json > \
	staging/$currentPerformanceYear/measures-data-pi.json

# 0c. Add IA measures to the staging measures-data-ia.json file:
node scripts/measures/$currentPerformanceYear/import-ia-measures.js \
	$ia_csv $ia_measures

# TODO: Enrich `measures-data.json` file, run:
# node scripts/measures/enrich-measures-data.js \
#	$staging_measures_with_qcdrs $final_measures

# 1. Merge the array/jsonfile-per-measureType into a combined array of all measures
node scripts/measures/$currentPerformanceYear/merge-measures-data.js \
	$quality_measures $pi_measures $ia_measures \
	$final_measures

# 2. To regenerate the `measures-data.xml` file, run:
echo "generating measures-data.xml from measures-data.json"
cat measures/$currentPerformanceYear/measures-data.json | \
	node scripts/convert-json-to-xml.js \
		> measures/$currentPerformanceYear/measures-data.xml

# 3. Validate the resulting measures-data.json file:
echo "validating new measures-data.json"
cat measures/$currentPerformanceYear/measures-data.json | \
	node scripts/validate-data.js measures $currentPerformanceYear
