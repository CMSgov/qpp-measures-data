ABFM PRIME,ABFM8,Measuring the Value-Functions of Primary Care: Provider Level Continuity Measure,"Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Primary Care Physician Measure (BB-COC-PC).  

At a patient-level, BB-COC is a measure that considers the dispersion of primary care visits across providers, such that patients with higher scores have most of their primary care visits to the same provider or a small number of providers while those lower scores see a larger number providers.  Formally, an individual BB-COC score is calculated as follows:

BB-COC=(∑_(i=1)^k n_i^2 -N)/(N(N-1))    (1)

where k is the number of providers, n_i is the number of visits to provider i, and N is the total number of visits.  (Note that it is necessary that the patient has at least two visits.)
We will calculate the physician-level continuity measure for all patients as follows: 
  
BB-COC-PC=(∑_1^k _((BB-COC)(n_k ))_)/(N*(n_k))  (2)

Where BB-COC is the individual patient continuity score, n is number of total primary care visits for patient k during the study period, and N is the total number of patients seen by the physicians during the study period.

Hawkins Foundation in Collaboration with SunCoast RHIO and CERortho,HF4,Shoulder Arthroscopy: Measure of Change in a Validated Shoulder Patient Reported Outcome Following Shoulder Arthroscopy,"The change in a validated shoulder measure score will be used as a performance measure for surgeons performing shoulder arthroscopy which includes rotator cuff debridement, biceps tenodesis and acromioplasty procedures. Two measures will be created and reported by each surgeon. Surgeons will report the average shoulder measure change score for patients treated during the observation period. In addition, surgeons will produce a risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score ratio by dividing the average patient shoulder measure change score by the average predicted patient shoulder measure change score calculated using the formula provided. These measures will serve as sports medicine performance measures at the eligible surgeon level. Eligible validated shoulder patient reported outcome measures include: American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) [1]. Defining the population: CPT-4 codes will be used to identify patients who received shoulder arthroscopy surgery. Shoulder arthroscopy during the reporting period CPT-4 Codes: 29822, 29823, 29826, 29828, 23430, 29999. Surgeons who performed a minimum of 25 shoulder arthroscopy procedures a year will be eligible to submit this measure. Time period for data collection and reporting: This measure will be calculated using all patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy during the observation period. Patients receiving shoulder arthroscopy during the period 18 to 6 months prior to the reporting data will be included in the analysis to ensure 6 months of patient-reported follow-up in the shoulder measure score are available. Measures: Two surgeon-level performance measures will be reported. The unadjusted measure will be the average 6-month shoulder measure change score across all shoulder arthroscopy patients treated by the surgeon. The adjusted measure will be the ratio of the average shoulder measure change score divided by the average predicted shoulder measure change score for all patients treated by the surgeon. Unadjusted measure: Average Shoulder Measure Change Score. NUMERATOR: Sum of shoulder measure change scores from pre-surgery to 6-months post-surgery across all shoulder arthroscopy patients in the denominator. DENOMINATOR: The number of all patients who received shoulder arthroscopy during the observation window from the surgeon. Type of score: Validated shoulder measure change score average. Risk adjusted measure: Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio. NUMERATOR: Average 6-month shoulder measure change score for all shoulder arthroscopy patients treated by surgeon. DENOMINATOR: Average predicted 6-month shoulder measure change score for all shoulder arthroscopy patients treated by surgeon. Risk adjustment methods and variables: The predicted 6-month shoulder measure change scores are estimated for each patient using the Center for Effectiveness Research in Orthopaedics' (CERortho) risk adjustment regression model that includes the following patient variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker's compensation status, prior shoulder surgery, tear size, concomitant shoulder procedures, the baseline shoulder measure score, and baseline measures of pain, shoulder function, and quality of life. [2-6]. Variables included in the current CERortho risk model are based on information in available databases. CERortho plans to constantly update these specified variables based on input from evaluated surgeons and specialty organizations. Appendix A contains the list of baseline concepts from peer-reviewed literature that are thought to affect outcomes of treatment and will be candidates for future inclusion in the model. Type of score: Ratio score; Interpretation of score: Surgeons with ratio scores equal to 1 have quality scores equal to the average surgeon given the characteristics of their patients. Surgeons with ratio scores greater than 1 had shoulder change scores higher than average. Surgeons with ratios scores less than 1 had shoulder change scores lower than average given the characteristics of their patients. Definitions: Patient's Shoulder Measure Score: A shoulder measure score is produced when the patient answers a validated shoulder assessment administered in the clinic or through an online portal. Patient's Shoulder Measure Change Score: A patient's change score is calculated by subtracting the patient's shoulder measure score at baseline from the patient's shoulder measure score at 6 months. Patient's Shoulder Measure Predicted Adjusted Change Score: Shoulder measure change scores for patients are risk adjusted using a regression model that includes the following independent variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker's compensation status, prior shoulder surgery, tear size, concomitant shoulder procedures, the baseline shoulder measure score, and baseline measures of pain, shoulder function, and quality of life. [2-6] The patient's predicted shoulder measure change score is the dependent variable. The regression model produces a risk-adjusted predicted shoulder measure change score for each patient. Risk-adjusted Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio: The ratio between the actual change scores and the predicted change scores (after risk adjustment) is the ratio score. The risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score represents risk-adjusted change corrected for patient characteristics. A risk-adjusted ratio score of one or greater should be interpreted as change scores that were as good as or better than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. Risk-adjusted ratio change scores less than one should be interpreted as shoulder measure change scores that were less than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. The surgeon ratio scores can be used to make comparisons across surgeons. Steps: 1. Prior to shoulder arthroscopy surgery the patient completes a baseline validated shoulder measure assessment which generates the patient's shoulder measure score at baseline. 2. Six months after surgery, the patient completes the same validated shoulder measure assessment again, which generates the patient's shoulder measure score at 6 months. 3. The patient's raw, unadjusted shoulder measure change score is generated by subtracting the baseline score from the 6-month score. Unadjusted measure: 4. Patients' shoulder measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. Adjusted measure: 5.A risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score is predicted using the CERortho risk-adjustment regression model. 6. Patients' unadjusted and adjusted shoulder measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. 7. A risk-adjusted Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio is generated for each surgeon. 8.The ratio scores for all surgeons in the database are ranked.

2) How much effort was made to listen to the things that matter most to you about your health issues? 
3) How much effort was made to include what matters most to you in choosing what to do next?                      4) How much effort was made to explain whether treatment options are effective or not?
Each item response is given on a 10-point scale, from 0 (No effort was made) to 9 (Every effort was made). The CollaboRATE Shared Decision Making Score represents the proportion of top box scores, i.e. the proportion of all responses with scores of 9 for each of the four collaboRATE items. Patient must answer all 4 questions with a ""top box"" score in order to be numerator compliant.

Appropriate Use of CTPs for a DFU or VLU is defined as use that adheres to Medicare coverage policy regarding the total number of applications over a specific time frame.   While various Medicare policies indicate that a typical episode of care for a wound is 12 weeks, US Wound Registry data indicate this time frame is much too short.  Additionally, the majority of patients have more than one wound.  Coverage policies do not provide the guidance necessary to address all of these issues in our measure.  Therefore, we will use a per wound basis, and assume the episode is the reporting period.",N/A,Effective Clinical Care,No,Process,No,Yes,No,No,1,1st Performance Rate,No,U.S. Wound Registry,2017

Using the Self-MNA  by Nestlé, if a patient at risk of malnutrition has an MNA score of 8-11 and documented weight loss, the clinician should subsequently create a follow up plan (e.g. diet enhancement and oral supplementation of 400 kcal/d2), close weight monitoring, and a more in depth nutrition assessment. Malnourished patients with scores of 0-7 would be offered treatment with nutritional intervention (ONS 400-600 kcal/d2 and diet enhancement), close weight monitoring and a more in depth nutrition assessment. No specific products will be recommended as part of the measure.

There are four rates reported for this measure. The four rates will be risk stratified into three buckets which are the following:
Rate 1: No evidence of arterial disease and ischemia is not a contributor to non-healing
Rate 2: Possible arterial compromise (possible reduced flow), but the patient may still be able to heal the wound(s) or ulcer(s)
Rate 3: Evidence of arterial disease- patient should be referred to specialist for vascular assessment if not currently in the care of a vascular expert. Ischemia may be the reason the patient has failed to heal.
