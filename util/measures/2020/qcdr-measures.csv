ABFM PRIME,ABFM9,Measuring the Value-Functions of Primary Care: Provider Level Continuity Measure,"Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Primary Care Physician Measure (BB-COC-PC).

At a patient-level, BB-COC is a measure that considers the dispersion of primary care visits across providers, such that patients with higher scores have most of their primary care visits to the same provider or a small number of providers while those lower scores see a larger number providers. Formally, an individual BB-COC score is calculated as follows:

BB-COC=(∑_(i=1)^k n_i^2 -N)/(N(N-1)) (1)

where k is the number of providers, n_i is the number of visits to provider i, and N is the total number of visits. (Note that it is necessary that the patient has at least two visits.)
We will calculate the physician-level continuity measure for all patients as follows:

BB-COC-PC=(∑_1^k 〖((BB-COC)(n_k ))〗)/(N*(n_k)) (2)

Where BB-COC is the individual patient continuity score, n is number of total primary care visits for patient k during the study period, and N is the total number of patients seen by the physicians during the study period. This approach gives greater weight to patients with more visits.

3) How much effort was made to include what matters most to you in choosing what to do next?      4) How much effort was made to explain whether treatment options are effective or not?
Each item response is given on a 10-point scale, from 0 (No effort was made) to 9 (Every effort was made). The CollaboRATE Shared Decision Making Score represents the proportion of top box scores, i.e. the proportion of all responses with scores of 9 for each of the four collaboRATE items. Patient must answer all 4 questions with a “top box” score in order to be numerator compliant. If a patient does not answer one of the four questions, this would not meet the intent of the measure. CollaboRATE was developed to be generic and was designed so that it could apply to all clinical encounters, irrespective of medical condition or patient group.

The location of the diabetic foot ulcer on the foot (e.g. heel/midfoot vs. toes) determines the type of off-loading device that is appropriate, the patient's risk of falling, the probability of successful off-loading and thus the likelihood of major amputation. The clinician needs to assess the most appropriate off-loading option based on many different factors.

Using the Self-MNA® by Nestlé, if a patient at risk of malnutrition has an MNA score of 8-11 and documented weight loss, the clinician should subsequently create a follow up plan (e.g. diet enhancement and oral supplementation of 400 kcal/d2), close weight monitoring, and a more in depth nutrition assessment. Malnourished patients with scores of 0-7 would be offered treatment with nutritional intervention (ONS 400-600 kcal/d2 and diet enhancement), close weight monitoring and a more in depth nutrition assessment. No specific products will be recommended as part of the measure. A follow up plan is documented during the encounter from the patient reported nutritional assessment.

Performance Rate Descriptions:

There are four rates reported for this measure. The four rates will be risk stratified into three buckets which are the following:
1.	No evidence of arterial disease and ischemia is not a contributor to non-healing
2.	Possible arterial compromise (possible reduced flow), but the patient may still be able to heal the wound(s) or ulcer(s)
3.	Evidence of arterial disease- patient should be referred to specialist for vascular assessment if not currently in the care of a vascular expert. Ischemia may be the reason the patient has failed to heal.
