Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way). Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient’s status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

The numerator is the number of those patients whose Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index is >= 0.7. The Bice-Boxerman index is a validated measure of patient-level care continuity that ranges from 0 to 1; 0 reflects completely disjointed care and 1 reflects complete continuity with the same PCP for all visits. The Bice-Boxerman index was used in a previously NQF endorsed measure for children with medical complexity. Compared to lower scores (e.g., 0.6 or lower), continuity index scores of 0.7 or higher have been associated with significantly lower Medicare expenditures and significantly lower odds of hospitalization.\nReferences: \n1.

The change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Dizziness Positional Status (DPS) or Dizziness Functional Status (DFS) PROM; these are item-response theory-based PROMs developed using items from the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), scored using the T-score metric (mean=50, SD=10), with higher scores representing better FS. \n\nThe DPS and DFS measure separate domains represented within DHI items.  The DPS score will be applied to this quality measure for patients with a statistically derived DPS cut-score (T-score) of 55 or lower whereas the DFS score will be applied for patients with a DPS T-score of greater than 55 at initial evaluation.  This approach is consistent with clinical and research observations that two types of vestibular impairments, positional- and functional-dominant, may have distinctly different clinical presentations and expected outcomes.  \n\nUsing a single PROM score derived from all 25 DHI items is not recommended due to score validity weaknesses; robust analyses using extensive exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses based on over 28,000 episodes of care determined the DHI items represent multiple domains, thus using a single overall score would pose a threat to validity. However, patient responses to DHI items may be used to directly score the DPS and DFS, allowing clinicians greater flexibility of choice of PROM used in routine clinical care without adding to clinician nor patient burden.\n\nTo fairly measure performance between providers, this quality measure is risk-adjusted to patient characteristics known to be associated with FS outcomes and used as a performance measure at the patient and provider levels to assess quality.",

For patients with such conditions affecting use of the hand, arm, and upper trunk, the change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Stroke Upper Extremity (SUE) FS PROM. For patients with such conditions affecting the foot, leg, and lower trunk, the change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Stroke Lower Extremity (SLE) FS PROM. PROM cores were scaled to the 0-100 metric, with higher scores representing higher perceived functional status. In order to fairly measure performance between providers, the measure is risk-adjusted to patient characteristics known to be associated with FS outcomes and used as a performance measure (PM) at the patient and provider levels to assess quality.",

Lower extremity pressure ulcers are not included in this measure because they commonly overlap with arterial and diabetic foot ulcers and require a separate risk stratification model.

This measure is limited to open defects (stages 2, 3, 4) which heal by secondary intention or surgical closure, typically referred to as ulcers.
