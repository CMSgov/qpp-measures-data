COST_EOPCI_1,Elective Outpatient Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI),"The Elective Outpatient PCI cost measure is meant to apply to clinicians who perform Elective Outpatient PCIs for Medicare beneficiaries during the performance period. This surgical procedure is meant to place a coronary artery stent for heart disease in a non-emergent, outpatient setting.

The cost of each episode is the sum of the cost to Medicare for services performed by the attributed clinician and other health care providers over the length of the episode, or ""episode window."" The cost measure is calculated by determining the risk-adjusted episode cost, averaged across all of a clinician's episodes during the performance period.

The cost of each episode is the sum of the cost to Medicare for services performed by the attributed clinician and other health care providers over the length of the episode, or “episode window.” The cost measure is calculated by determining the risk-adjusted episode cost,  averaged across all of a clinician’s episodes during the performance period.",2019,,costScore,TRUE,,administrativeClaims
COST_IHCI_1,Intracranial Hemorrhage or Cerebral Infarction,"The Intracranial Hemorrhage or Cerebral Infarction cost measure is meant to apply to clinicians who manage the inpatient care of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for an intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral infarction during the performance period. This cost measure excludes those patients whose initial hospitalization was due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage or a cerebral infarction which received thrombolytic therapy. The measure evaluates a clinician’s risk-adjusted cost for the episode group by averaging it across all episodes attributed to the clinician. The cost of each episode is the sum of the cost to Medicare for services performed by the attributed clinician and other health care providers over the length of the episode, or “episode window.” The cost measure is calculated by determining the risk-adjusted episode cost,  averaged across all of a clinician’s episodes during the performance period.

MSPB_1,Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB),"The Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB) measure evaluates solo practitioners and groups on their spending efficiency and is risk-adjusted to account for patients' risk profiles. Solo practitioners and groups are identified by their National Provider Identification (NPI) and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) combination. Specifically, the MSPB measure assesses the average spend for Medicare services performed by providers/groups per episode of care. Each episode comprises the period immediately prior to, during, and following a patient's hospital stay.",2017,,costScore,TRUE,simpleAverage,administrativeClaims
