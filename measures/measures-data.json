This includes the provision of all necessary information to the patient that will allow the patient to enroll in an outpatient CR program. This also includes a written or electronic communication between the healthcare provider or healthcare system and the cardiac rehabilitation program that includes the patient's enrollment information for the program. A hospital discharge summary or office note may potentially be formatted to include the necessary patient information to communicate to the CR program (the patient’s cardiovascular history, testing, and treatments, for instance). According to standards of practice for cardiac rehabilitation programs, care coordination communications are sent to the referring provider, including any issues regarding treatment changes, adverse treatment responses, or new non-emergency condition (new symptoms, patient care questions, etc.) that need attention by the referring provider. These communications also include a progress report once the patient has completed the program. All communications must maintain an appropriate level of confidentiality as outlined by the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Note: A patient with a qualifying diagnosis should have a referral to CR within the subsequent 12 months. In the event that the patient has a second (recurrent) qualifying event before the original 12 month “referral” period has ended, a new 12 month “referral” period for CR referral starts at the time of the second qualifying event, since the patient again becomes eligible for CR at that time.",

Two measures will be created and reported by each surgeon. Surgeons will report the average knee measure change score for patients treated during the observation period. In addition, surgeons will produce a risk-adjusted knee measure change score ratio by dividing the average patient knee measure change score by the average predicted patient knee measure change score calculated using the formula provided. These measures will serve as sports medicine performance measures at the eligible surgeon level. Eligible validated knee patient reported outcome measures include: International Knee Documental Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form (Pedi-IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) [1]. Defining the population: CPT-4 procedure codes will be used to identify patients who received knee arthroscopy for meniscectomy. Isolated Meniscectomy during the reporting period CPT-4 Codes: 29880, 29881. Excluding concurrent with Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (29888) and other concomitant procedures. Surgeons who performed a minimum of 25 meniscectomy procedures a year will be eligible to submit this measure. Time period for data collection and reporting: This measure will be calculated using all patients who underwent meniscectomy during the observation period. Patients receiving meniscectomy during the period 18 to 6 months prior to the reporting data will be included in the analysis to ensure 6 months of patient-reported follow-up in the knee measure score are available. Measures: Two surgeon-level performance measures will be reported. The unadjusted measure will be the average 6-month knee measure change score across all meniscectomy patients treated by the surgeon. The adjusted measure will be the ratio of the average knee measure change score divided by the average predicted knee measure change score for all patients treated by the surgeon. Unadjusted measure: Average Knee Measure Change Score. NUMERATOR: Sum of knee measure change scores from pre-surgery to 6-months post-surgery across all meniscectomy patients in the denominator. DENOMINATOR: The number of all patients who received meniscectomy during the observation window from the surgeon. Type of score: Validated knee measure change score average. Risk adjusted measure: Knee Measure Change Score Ratio. NUMERATOR: Average 6-month knee measure change score for all meniscectomy patients treated by surgeon. DENOMINATOR: Average predicted 6-month knee measure change score for all meniscectomy patients treated by surgeon. Risk adjustment methods and variables: The predicted 6 month knee measure change scores are estimated for each patient using the Center for Effectiveness Research in Orthopaedics’ (CERortho) risk adjustment regression model that includes the following patient variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, history or prior knee surgery, sport participation/activity level, osteoarthritis, concomitant chondral injury, the baseline knee measure, and baseline measures of pain, knee function, and quality of life.[2-4]. Variables included in the current CERortho risk model are based on information in available databases. CERortho plans to constantly update these specified variables based on input from evaluated surgeons and specialty organizations. Appendix A contains the list of baseline concepts from peer-reviewed literature that are thought to affect outcomes of treatment and will be candidates for future inclusion in the model. Type of score: Ratio score; Interpretation of score: Surgeons with ratio scores equal to 1 have quality scores equal to the average surgeon given the characteristics of their patients. Surgeons with ratio scores greater than 1 had knee change scores higher than average. Surgeons with ratios scores less than 1 had knee change scores lower than average given the characteristics of their patients. Definitions: Patient’s Knee Measure Score: A knee measure score is produced when the patient answers a validated knee assessment administered in the clinic or through an online portal. Patient’s Knee Measure Change Score: A patient’s change score is calculated by subtracting the patient’s knee measure score at baseline from the patient’s knee measure score at 6 months. Patient’s Knee Measure Predicted Adjusted Change Score: Knee measure change scores for patients are risk adjusted using a regression model that includes the following independent variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, history or prior knee surgery, sport participation/activity level, osteoarthritis, concomitant chondral injury, the baseline knee measure, and baseline measures of pain, knee function, and quality of life.[2-4] The patient’s predicted knee measure change score is the dependent variable. The regression model produces a risk-adjusted predicted knee measure change score for each patient. Risk-adjusted Knee Measure Change Score Ratio: The ratio between the actual change scores and the predicted change scores (after risk adjustment) is the ratio score. The risk-adjusted knee measure change score represents risk-adjusted change corrected for patient characteristics. A risk-adjusted ratio score of one or greater should be interpreted as change scores that were as good as or better than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. Risk-adjusted ratio change scores less than one should be interpreted as knee measure change scores that were less than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. The surgeon ratio scores can be used to make comparisons across surgeons. Steps: 1. Prior to meniscectomy surgery the patient completes a baseline validated knee measure assessment which generates the patient’s knee measure score at baseline; 2. Six months after surgery, the patient completes the same validated knee measure assessment again, which generates the patient’s knee measure score at 6 months; 3. The patient’s raw, unadjusted knee measure change score is generated by subtracting the baseline score from the 6-month score; Unadjusted measure: 4. Patients’ knee measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. Adjusted measure:  5. A risk-adjusted knee measure change score is predicted using the CERortho risk-adjustment regression model. 6. Patients’ unadjusted and adjusted knee measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. 7. A risk-adjusted Knee Measure Change Score Ratio is generated for each surgeon. 8.The ratio scores for all surgeons in the database are ranked. See attached for references...",

    "description": "The change in a validated shoulder measure score will be used as a performance measure for surgeons performing shoulder arthroscopy which includes rotator cuff debridement, biceps tenodesis and acromioplasty procedures. Two measures will be created and reported by each surgeon. Surgeons will report the average shoulder measure change score for patients treated during the observation period. In addition, surgeons will produce a risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score ratio by dividing the average patient shoulder measure change score by the average predicted patient shoulder measure change score calculated using the formula provided. These measures will serve as sports medicine performance measures at the eligible surgeon level. Eligible validated shoulder patient reported outcome measures include: American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) [1]. Defining the population: CPT-4 codes will be used to identify patients who received shoulder arthroscopy surgery. Shoulder arthroscopy during the reporting period CPT-4 Codes: 29822, 29823, 29826, 29828, 23430, 29999. Surgeons who performed a minimum of 25 shoulder arthroscopy procedures a year will be eligible to submit this measure. Time period for data collection and reporting: This measure will be calculated using all patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy during the observation period. Patients receiving shoulder arthroscopy during the period 18 to 6 months prior to the reporting data will be included in the analysis to ensure 6 months of patient-reported follow-up in the shoulder measure score are available. Measures: Two surgeon-level performance measures will be reported. The unadjusted measure will be the average 6-month shoulder measure change score across all shoulder arthroscopy patients treated by the surgeon. The adjusted measure will be the ratio of the average shoulder measure change score divided by the average predicted shoulder measure change score for all patients treated by the surgeon. Unadjusted measure: Average Shoulder Measure Change Score. NUMERATOR: Sum of shoulder measure change scores from pre-surgery to 6-months post-surgery across all shoulder arthroscopy patients in the denominator. DENOMINATOR: The number of all patients who received shoulder arthroscopy during the observation window from the surgeon. Type of score: Validated shoulder measure change score average. Risk adjusted measure: Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio. NUMERATOR: Average 6-month shoulder measure change score for all shoulder arthroscopy patients treated by surgeon. DENOMINATOR: Average predicted 6-month shoulder measure change score for all shoulder arthroscopy patients treated by surgeon. Risk adjustment methods and variables: The predicted 6-month shoulder measure change scores are estimated for each patient using the Center for Effectiveness Research in Orthopaedics’ (CERortho) risk adjustment regression model that includes the following patient variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, prior shoulder surgery, tear size, concomitant shoulder procedures, the baseline shoulder measure score, and baseline measures of pain, shoulder function, and quality of life. [2-6]. Variables included in the current CERortho risk model are based on information in available databases. CERortho plans to constantly update these specified variables based on input from evaluated surgeons and specialty organizations. Appendix A contains the list of baseline concepts from peer-reviewed literature that are thought to affect outcomes of treatment and will be candidates for future inclusion in the model. Type of score: Ratio score; Interpretation of score: Surgeons with ratio scores equal to 1 have quality scores equal to the average surgeon given the characteristics of their patients. Surgeons with ratio scores greater than 1 had shoulder change scores higher than average. Surgeons with ratios scores less than 1 had shoulder change scores lower than average given the characteristics of their patients. Definitions: Patient’s Shoulder Measure Score: A shoulder measure score is produced when the patient answers a validated shoulder assessment administered in the clinic or through an online portal. Patient’s Shoulder Measure Change Score: A patient’s change score is calculated by subtracting the patient’s shoulder measure score at baseline from the patient’s shoulder measure score at 6 months. Patient’s Shoulder Measure Predicted Adjusted Change Score: Shoulder measure change scores for patients are risk adjusted using a regression model that includes the following independent variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, prior shoulder surgery, tear size, concomitant shoulder procedures, the baseline shoulder measure score, and baseline measures of pain, shoulder function, and quality of life. [2-6] The patient’s predicted shoulder measure change score is the dependent variable. The regression model produces a risk-adjusted predicted shoulder measure change score for each patient. Risk-adjusted Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio: The ratio between the actual change scores and the predicted change scores (after risk adjustment) is the ratio score. The risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score represents risk-adjusted change corrected for patient characteristics. A risk-adjusted ratio score of one or greater should be interpreted as change scores that were as good as or better than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. Risk-adjusted ratio change scores less than one should be interpreted as shoulder measure change scores that were less than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. The surgeon ratio scores can be used to make comparisons across surgeons. Steps: 1. Prior to shoulder arthroscopy surgery the patient completes a baseline validated shoulder measure assessment which generates the patient’s shoulder measure score at baseline. 2. Six months after surgery, the patient completes the same validated shoulder measure assessment again, which generates the patient’s shoulder measure score at 6 months. 3. The patient’s raw, unadjusted shoulder measure change score is generated by subtracting the baseline score from the 6-month score. Unadjusted measure: 4. Patients’ shoulder measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. Adjusted measure: 5.A risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score is predicted using the CERortho risk-adjustment regression model. 6. Patients’ unadjusted and adjusted shoulder measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. 7. A risk-adjusted Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio is generated for each surgeon. 8.The ratio scores for all surgeons in the database are ranked. See Attachment for References.",

Pain patients typically have deficits in serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) secondary to pain chronicity and physiologic response. NE and 5-HT block pain in the ascending spine and deficiencies are associated with increased pain and the primary presenting symptom of 5- HT deficiency is anxiety.

Obesity, if causally related to pain, disease progression, and/or the major etiologic event must be addressed. Dose escalation for BMI escalation or maintenance is harmful and potentially dangerous to patients categorized as obese due to respiratory suppression and opiate/opioid related systemic endocrine dysfunction.

These surgeries carry risk to the patient and major expense to the system. Moreover, once a spinal fusion occurs, typically the areas above and/or below this area are fused in another 5-10 years. Avoiding the initial surgery is the only means to avoid subsequent surgeries and the associated risks and costs.
