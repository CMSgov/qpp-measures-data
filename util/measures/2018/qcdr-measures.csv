* There is no universal definition for “shared decision making” (SDM).  It is recommended the SDM included at minimum a discussion between the clinician and the patient and/or caregiver of the risks and benefits of treatment options for sensorineural hearing loss, including the option of no treatment, an elicitation patient values and preferences, and a notation of arriving at a mutually agreed upon decision.  The measure may be met using through documentation that any SDM for symmetric sensorineural hearing loss treatment options took place, any decision aids or SDM Tool/decision aid was used, or any other indication in the medical record that SDM regarding treatment options for symmetric sensorineural hearing loss took place. The provider may choose to use any decision aids, SDM steps/definitions or processes to demonstrate that SDM regarding treatment options for symmetric sensorineural hearing loss took place.

**Treatment Options:  There are many different treatment options for symmetric sensorineural hearing loss.  These treatment options may include, but are not limited to, the hearing technology option (e.g. Dartmouth option grid found at: http://optiongrid.org/pdf/grid/grids/27/27.en_us.1.pdf )

The option grid could include different categories of severity for hearing loss – mild, moderate, severe, profound – since treatment options and patient decisions will vary depending on severity with regards to:
1. Simple amplification/assistive listening devices
2. Aural rehabilitation including auditory (listening) training, speech (lip reading) training, or strategies to improve coping and communication.

*Audiometry Definition: Audiometry is defined as hearing testing performed by a certified professional, usually an audiologist, in a sound-proof booth and controlled environment.  This does NOT include screening tests or other crude tests of hearing performed in an open-air environment.  The preferred method of hearing assessment is age-appropriate audiologic testing, through conventional audiometry or comprehensive audiologic assessment. Children aged 4 years or older are suitable for conventional audiometry, in which the child raises his or her hand when a stimulus is heard. This can be done in the primary care setting using a fail criterion of >20 dB HL at 1 or more frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) in either ear.
Comprehensive audiologic evaluation by an audiologist is recommended for children aged 6 months to 4 years and for any child who fails conventional audiometry in a primary care setting.   This assessment includes evaluating air-conduction and bone-conduction thresholds for pure tones, speech detection or speech recognition thresholds, and measuring speech understanding if possible.  Visual response audiometry is typically used to assess hearing in children aged 6 months to 2.5 years. It is performed by an audiologist, during which the child learns to associate speech or frequency-specific stimuli with a reinforcer, such as a lighted toy or video clips. Children aged 2.5 to 4 years are assessed using play audiometry, by having the child perform a task (e.g. placing a peg in a pegboard or dropping a block in a box) in response to a stimulus tone. Ear-specific audiologic testing is recommended whenever possible using insert earphones to detect unilateral or asymmetrical hearing loss.

4849508,ABFM8,Measuring the Value-Functions of Primary Care: Provider Level Continuity Measure,"Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Primary Care Physician Measure (BB-COC-PC).

At a patient-level, BB-COC is a measure that considers the dispersion of primary care visits across providers, such that patients with higher scores have most of their primary care visits to the same provider or a small number of providers while those lower scores see a larger number providers.  Formally, an individual BB-COC score is calculated as follows:

BB-COC=(∑_(i=1)^k n_i^2 -N)/(N(N-1))    (1)

where k is the number of providers, n_i is the number of visits to provider i, and N is the total number of visits.  (Note that it is necessary that the patient has at least two visits.)
We will calculate the physician-level continuity measure for all patients as follows:

BB-COC-PC=(∑_1^k 〖((BB-COC)(n_k ))〗)/(N*(n_k))  (2)

Where BB-COC is the individual patient continuity score, n is number of total primary care visits for patient k during the study period, and N is the total number of patients seen by the physicians during the study period.  This approach gives greater weight to patients with more visits.",Communication and Care Coordination,The numerator in equation (2) is the weighted sum of the BB-COC scores of patients (with 2 or more visits) cared for a primary care physician.

The location of the diabetic foot ulcer on the foot (e.g. heel/midfoot vs. toes) determines the type of off-loading device that is appropriate, the patient's risk of falling, the probability of successful off-loading and thus the likelihood of major amputation.  The clinician needs to assess the most appropriate off-loading option based on many different factors.

There are three rates reported for this measure.
The three rates will be risk stratified into two buckets (location of wound and/or ulcer) which are the following:

Two measures will be created and reported by each surgeon. Surgeons will report the average knee measure change score for patients treated during the observation period. In addition, surgeons will produce a risk-adjusted knee measure change score ratio by dividing the average patient knee measure change score by the average predicted patient knee measure change score calculated using the formula provided. These measures will serve as sports medicine performance measures at the eligible surgeon level. Eligible validated knee patient reported outcome measures include: International Knee Documental Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form (Pedi-IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) [1]. Defining the population: CPT-4 procedure codes will be used to identify patients who received ACL reconstruction without treatment of chondral injury. ACL reconstruction during the reporting period CPT-4 Codes: 29888. Surgeons who performed a minimum of 25 ACL reconstructions a year will be eligible to submit this measure. Time period for data collection and reporting: This measure will be calculated using all patients who underwent ACL reconstruction during the observation period. Patients receiving ACL reconstruction during the period 18 to 6 months prior to the reporting data will be included in the analysis to ensure 6 months of patient-reported follow-up in the knee measure score are available. Measures: Two surgeon-level performance measures will be reported. The unadjusted measure will be the average 6-month knee measure change score across all ACL reconstruction patients treated by the surgeon. The adjusted measure will be the ratio of the average knee measure change score divided by the average predicted knee measure change score for all patients treated by the surgeon. Unadjusted measure: Average Knee Measure Change Score. NUMERATOR: Sum of knee measure change scores from pre-surgery to 6-months post-surgery across all ACL reconstruction patients in the denominator. DENOMINATOR: The number of all patients who received ACL reconstruction during the observation window from the surgeon. Type of score: Validated knee measure change score average. Risk adjusted measure: Knee Measure Change Score Ratio. NUMERATOR: Average 6-month knee measure change score for all ACL reconstruction patients treated by surgeon. DENOMINATOR: Average predicted 6-month knee measure change score for all ACL reconstruction patients treated by surgeon. Risk adjustment methods and variables: The predicted 6 month knee measure change scores are estimated for each patient using the Center for Effectiveness Research in Orthopaedics’ (CERortho) risk adjustment regression model that includes the following patient variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, history or prior knee surgery, sport participation/activity level, osteoarthritis, concomitant chondral injury, the baseline knee measure, and baseline measures of pain, knee function, and quality of life.[2-4]. Variables included in the current CERortho risk model are based on information in available databases. CERortho plans to constantly update these specified variables based on input from evaluated surgeons and specialty organizations. Appendix A contains the list of baseline concepts from peer-reviewed literature that are thought to affect outcomes of treatment and will be candidates for future inclusion in the model. Type of score: Ratio score; Interpretation of score: Surgeons with ratio scores equal to 1 have quality scores equal to the average surgeon given the characteristics of their patients. Surgeons with ratio scores greater than 1 had knee change scores higher than average. Surgeons with ratios scores less than 1 had knee change scores lower than average given the characteristics of their patients. Definitions: Patient’s Knee Measure Score: A knee measure score is produced when the patient answers a validated knee assessment administered in the clinic or through an online portal. Patient’s Knee Measure Change Score: A patient’s change score is calculated by subtracting the patient’s knee measure score at baseline from the patient’s knee measure score at 6 months. Patient’s Knee Measure Predicted Adjusted Change Score: Knee measure change scores for patients are risk adjusted using a regression model that includes the following independent variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, history or prior knee surgery, sport participation/activity level, osteoarthritis, concomitant chondral injury, the baseline knee measure, and baseline measures of pain, knee function, and quality of life.[2-4] The patient’s predicted knee measure change score is the dependent variable. The regression model produces a risk-adjusted predicted knee measure change score for each patient. Risk-adjusted Knee Measure Change Score Ratio: The ratio between the actual change scores and the predicted change scores (after risk adjustment) is the ratio score. The risk-adjusted knee measure change score represents risk-adjusted change corrected for patient characteristics. A risk-adjusted ratio score of one or greater should be interpreted as change scores that were as good as or better than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. Risk-adjusted ratio change scores less than one should be interpreted as knee measure change scores that were less than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. The surgeon ratio scores can be used to make comparisons across surgeons. Steps: 1. Prior to ACL reconstruction surgery the patient completes a baseline validated knee measure assessment which generates the patient’s knee measure score at baseline; 2. Six months after surgery, the patient completes the same validated knee measure assessment again, which generates the patient’s knee measure score at 6 months; 3. The patient’s raw, unadjusted knee measure change score is generated by subtracting the baseline score from the 6-month score; Unadjusted measure: 4. Patients’ knee measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. Adjusted measure:  5. A risk-adjusted knee measure change score is predicted using the CERortho risk-adjustment regression model. 6.

Eligible validated knee patient reported outcome measures include: International Knee Documental Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form (Pedi-IKDC), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) [1]Defining the population:
CPT-4 procedure codes will be used to identify patients who received knee arthroscopy for meniscal repair. Meniscal repair during the reporting period CPT-4 Codes: 29882, 29883. Excluding concurrent procedures including Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (29888). Surgeons who performed a minimum of 25 meniscal repair procedures a year will be eligible to submit this measure. Time period for data collection and reporting:
This measure will be calculated using all patients who underwent meniscal repair during the observation period. Patients receiving meniscal repair during the period 18 to 6 months prior to the reporting data will be included in the analysis to ensure 6 months of patient-reported follow-up in the knee measure score are available. Measures: Two surgeon-level performance measures will be reported. The unadjusted measure will be the average 6-month knee measure change score across all meniscal repair patients treated by the surgeon. The adjusted measure will be the ratio of the average knee measure change score divided by the average predicted knee measure change score for all patients treated by the surgeon. Unadjusted measure: Average Knee Measure Change Score. NUMERATOR: Sum of knee measure change scores from pre-surgery to 6-months post-surgery across all meniscal repair patients in the denominator. DENOMINATOR: The number of all patients who received meniscal repair during the observation window from the surgeon. Type of score: Validated knee measure change score average; Risk adjusted measure: Knee Measure Change Score Ratio. NUMERATOR: Average 6-month knee measure change score for all meniscal repair patients treated by surgeon. DENOMINATOR: Average predicted 6-month knee measure change score for all meniscal repair patients treated by surgeon. Risk adjustment methods and variables: The predicted 6-month knee measure change scores are estimated for each patient using the Center for Effectiveness Research in Orthopaedics’ (CERortho) risk adjustment regression model that includes the following patient variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, history or prior knee surgery, sport participation/activity level, osteoarthritis, concomitant chondral injury, the baseline knee measure, and baseline measures of pain, knee function, and quality of life.[2-4] Variables included in the current CERortho risk model are based on information in available databases. CERortho plans to constantly update these specified variables based on input from evaluated surgeons and specialty organizations. Appendix A contains the list of baseline concepts from peer-reviewed literature that are thought to affect outcomes of treatment and will be candidates for future inclusion in the model.
Type of score: Ratio score
Interpretation of score:
Surgeons with ratio scores equal to 1 have quality scores equal to the average surgeon given the characteristics of their patients. Surgeons with ratio scores greater than 1 had knee change scores higher than average. Surgeons with ratios scores less than 1 had knee change scores lower than average given the characteristics of their patients. Definitions:
Patient’s Knee Measure Score: A knee measure score is produced when the patient answers a validated knee assessment administered in the clinic or through an online portal.
Patient’s Knee Measure Change Score: A patient’s change score is calculated by subtracting the patient’s knee measure score at baseline from the patient’s knee measure score at 6 months. Patient's Knee Measure Predicted Adjusted Change Score: Knee measure change scores for patients are risk adjusted using a regression model that includes the following independent variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker’s compensation status, history or prior knee surgery, sport participation/activity level, osteoarthritis, concomitant chondral injury, the baseline knee measure, and baseline measures of pain, knee function, and quality of life.[2-4] The patient’s predicted knee measure change score is the dependent variable. The regression model produces a risk-adjusted predicted knee measure change score for each patient. Risk-adjusted Knee Measure Change Score Ratio: The ratio between the actual change scores and the predicted change scores (after risk adjustment) is the ratio score. The risk-adjusted knee measure change score represents risk-adjusted change corrected for patient characteristics. A risk-adjusted ratio score of one or greater should be interpreted as change scores that were as good as or better than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. Risk-adjusted ratio change scores less than one should be interpreted as knee measure change scores that were less than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. The surgeon ratio scores can be used to make comparisons across surgeons. Steps: 1. Prior to meniscal repair surgery the patient completes a baseline validated knee measure assessment which generates the patient’s knee measure score at baseline. 2. Six months after surgery, the patient completes the same validated knee measure assessment again, which generates the patient’s knee measure score at 6 months. 3. The patient’s raw, unadjusted knee measure change score is generated by subtracting the baseline score from the 6-month score. Unadjusted measure: 4. Patients’ knee measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. Adjusted measure: 5. A risk-adjusted knee measure change score is predicted using the CERortho risk-adjustment regression model. 6. Patients’ unadjusted and adjusted knee measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. 7. A risk-adjusted Knee Measure Change Score Ratio is generated for each surgeon. 8. The ratio scores for all surgeons in the database are ranked. See attachment for references.",Effective Clinical Care,"Unadjusted measure: Average Knee Measure Change Score

  b. If functionality 5 or less and/or pain 7 or more, medical record documentation of treatment change or diagnostic work up is present.
  c. Failure to document these changes with continued treatment despite lessening functionality and/or increasing pain would result in measure failure.

  Measure explanation:
  a.

Pain scale maintained between 4-6 for good control with current treatment regimen and/or a two-point improvement in pain since last visit for treatment with or without treatment adjustments. If this fails to occur provider changes technique or considers other intervention (i.e.: further diagnostics, referral, injections, prescription medication).
  b. If provider changes manipulative technique at the previous visit he/she uses QVAS at the subsequent visit to assess impact of change in technique or intervention on current pain state where patient’s pain is above a 6 on a 0-10 scale with 0 being no pain and 10 greatest pain and/or functionality is < 6 on a 0- 10 scale with 10 most and 0 least functional.

If functionality 5 or less and/or pain 7 or more, medical record documentation of treatment change or diagnostic work up is present. Failure to document these changes with continued treatment despite lessening functionality and/or increasing pain would result in measure failure.

 Providers would be providing manual medicine in addition to non-traditional, but literature proven alternative medicine modalities (i.e.: acupuncture) with patients who have imaging confirmed spinal stenosis (M99 ICD-10 Code).

 Measure explanation: Spinal stenosis typically is conservatively managed until surgical fusion or foraminotomy is necessitated based upon pain or neuropathic progression necessitating spinal fusion and/or foraminotomy. These surgeries carry risk to the patient and major expense to the system. Moreover, once a spinal fusion occurs, typically the areas above and/or below this area are fused in another 5-10 years. Avoiding the initial surgery is the only means to avoid subsequent surgeries and the associated risks and costs. Manipulative medicine combined with alternative medical therapies have been shown to improve pain and avoid surgical intervention, thus, this measure is designed to report such treatment.",Patient Safety,"Numerator data will equal total imaging confirmed spinal stenosis (M99) patients receiving manipulative medicine or therapy for this complaint that was inadequate at providing pain relief and necessitated the addition of an alternative medicine therapy (i.e.: acupuncture) during the reporting period.
