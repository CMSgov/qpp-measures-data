Empanelment identifies the patients and population for whom the MIPS eligible clinician or group and/or care team is responsible and is the foundation for the relationship continuity between patient and MIPS eligible clinician or group /care team that is at the heart of comprehensive primary care. Effective empanelment requires identification of the \"active population\" of the practice: those patients who identify and use your practice as a source for primary care. There are many ways to define \"active patients\" operationally, but generally, the definition of \"active patients\" includes patients who have sought care within the last 24 to 36 months, allowing inclusion of younger patients who have minimal acute or preventive health care.",

Platforms and devices that collect patient-generated health data (PGHD) must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient, including patient reported outcomes (PROs). Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way).  Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient's status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

    "title": "Shoulder Arthroscopy: Measure of Change in a Validated Shoulder Patient Reported Outcome Following Shoulder Arthroscopy",
    "description": "The change in a validated shoulder measure score will be used as a performance measure for surgeons performing shoulder arthroscopy which includes rotator cuff debridement, biceps tenodesis and acromioplasty procedures. Two measures will be created and reported by each surgeon. Surgeons will report the average shoulder measure change score for patients treated during the observation period. In addition, surgeons will produce a risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score ratio by dividing the average patient shoulder measure change score by the average predicted patient shoulder measure change score calculated using the formula provided. These measures will serve as sports medicine performance measures at the eligible surgeon level. Eligible validated shoulder patient reported outcome measures include: American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) [1]. Defining the population: CPT-4 codes will be used to identify patients who received shoulder arthroscopy surgery. Shoulder arthroscopy during the reporting period CPT-4 Codes: 29822, 29823, 29826, 29828, 23430, 29999. Surgeons who performed a minimum of 25 shoulder arthroscopy procedures a year will be eligible to submit this measure. Time period for data collection and reporting: This measure will be calculated using all patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy during the observation period. Patients receiving shoulder arthroscopy during the period 18 to 6 months prior to the reporting data will be included in the analysis to ensure 6 months of patient-reported follow-up in the shoulder measure score are available. Measures: Two surgeon-level performance measures will be reported. The unadjusted measure will be the average 6-month shoulder measure change score across all shoulder arthroscopy patients treated by the surgeon. The adjusted measure will be the ratio of the average shoulder measure change score divided by the average predicted shoulder measure change score for all patients treated by the surgeon. Unadjusted measure: Average Shoulder Measure Change Score. NUMERATOR: Sum of shoulder measure change scores from pre-surgery to 6-months post-surgery across all shoulder arthroscopy patients in the denominator. DENOMINATOR: The number of all patients who received shoulder arthroscopy during the observation window from the surgeon. Type of score: Validated shoulder measure change score average. Risk adjusted measure: Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio. NUMERATOR: Average 6-month shoulder measure change score for all shoulder arthroscopy patients treated by surgeon. DENOMINATOR: Average predicted 6-month shoulder measure change score for all shoulder arthroscopy patients treated by surgeon. Risk adjustment methods and variables: The predicted 6-month shoulder measure change scores are estimated for each patient using the Center for Effectiveness Research in Orthopaedics' (CERortho) risk adjustment regression model that includes the following patient variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker's compensation status, prior shoulder surgery, tear size, concomitant shoulder procedures, the baseline shoulder measure score, and baseline measures of pain, shoulder function, and quality of life. [2-6]. Variables included in the current CERortho risk model are based on information in available databases. CERortho plans to constantly update these specified variables based on input from evaluated surgeons and specialty organizations. Appendix A contains the list of baseline concepts from peer-reviewed literature that are thought to affect outcomes of treatment and will be candidates for future inclusion in the model. Type of score: Ratio score; Interpretation of score: Surgeons with ratio scores equal to 1 have quality scores equal to the average surgeon given the characteristics of their patients. Surgeons with ratio scores greater than 1 had shoulder change scores higher than average. Surgeons with ratios scores less than 1 had shoulder change scores lower than average given the characteristics of their patients. Definitions: Patient's Shoulder Measure Score: A shoulder measure score is produced when the patient answers a validated shoulder assessment administered in the clinic or through an online portal. Patient's Shoulder Measure Change Score: A patient's change score is calculated by subtracting the patient's shoulder measure score at baseline from the patient's shoulder measure score at 6 months. Patient's Shoulder Measure Predicted Adjusted Change Score: Shoulder measure change scores for patients are risk adjusted using a regression model that includes the following independent variables: age, gender, BMI, smoking status, comorbidities, worker's compensation status, prior shoulder surgery, tear size, concomitant shoulder procedures, the baseline shoulder measure score, and baseline measures of pain, shoulder function, and quality of life. [2-6] The patient's predicted shoulder measure change score is the dependent variable. The regression model produces a risk-adjusted predicted shoulder measure change score for each patient. Risk-adjusted Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio: The ratio between the actual change scores and the predicted change scores (after risk adjustment) is the ratio score. The risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score represents risk-adjusted change corrected for patient characteristics. A risk-adjusted ratio score of one or greater should be interpreted as change scores that were as good as or better than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. Risk-adjusted ratio change scores less than one should be interpreted as shoulder measure change scores that were less than predicted given the risk-adjustment variables of the patient. The surgeon ratio scores can be used to make comparisons across surgeons. Steps: 1. Prior to shoulder arthroscopy surgery the patient completes a baseline validated shoulder measure assessment which generates the patient's shoulder measure score at baseline. 2. Six months after surgery, the patient completes the same validated shoulder measure assessment again, which generates the patient's shoulder measure score at 6 months. 3. The patient's raw, unadjusted shoulder measure change score is generated by subtracting the baseline score from the 6-month score. Unadjusted measure: 4. Patients' shoulder measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. Adjusted measure: 5.A risk-adjusted shoulder measure change score is predicted using the CERortho risk-adjustment regression model. 6. Patients' unadjusted and adjusted shoulder measure change scores are averaged by surgeon. 7. A risk-adjusted Shoulder Measure Change Score Ratio is generated for each surgeon. 8.The ratio scores for all surgeons in the database are ranked. See Attachment for References.",

The CollaboRATE Shared Decision Making Score represents the proportion of top box scores, i.e. the proportion of all responses with scores of 9 for each of the four collaboRATE items. Patient must answer all 4 questions with a \"top box\" score in order to be numerator compliant.

Appropriate Use of CTPs for a DFU or VLU is defined as use that adheres to Medicare coverage policy regarding the total number of applications over a specific time frame.   While various Medicare policies indicate that a typical episode of care for a wound is 12 weeks, US Wound Registry data indicate this time frame is much too short.  Additionally, the majority of patients have more than one wound.  Coverage policies do not provide the guidance necessary to address all of these issues in our measure.  Therefore, we will use a per wound basis, and assume the episode is the reporting period.",
