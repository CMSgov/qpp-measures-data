Quality,Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate Image Quality for Diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT) in Adults (Clinician Level) ,CMS1056v2,"3633e 3662e",,494,"Alara Imaging, Inc. in collaboration with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)",,"This measure provides a standardized method for monitoring the performance of diagnostic CT to discourage unnecessarily high radiation doses, a risk factor for cancer, while preserving image quality. It is expressed as a percentage of patients with CT exams that are out-of-range based on having either excessive radiation dose or inadequate image quality relative to evidence-based thresholds based on the clinical indication for the exam. All diagnostic CT exams of specified anatomic sites performed in inpatient, outpatient and ambulatory care settings are eligible. This measure is not telehealth eligible. This eCQM requires the use of additional software to access primary data elements stored within radiology electronic health records and translate them into data elements that can be ingested by this eCQM.

Quality,First Year Standardized Waitlist Ratio (FYSWR),,,,510,Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,,"The number of newly initiated patients on dialysis in a practitioner group who are under the age of 75 and were either listed on the kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant waitlist or received a living donor transplant within the first year of initiating dialysis. The practitioner group is inclusive of physicians and advanced practice providers. The measure is the ratio-observed number of waitlist events in a practitioner group to its expected number of waitlist events. The measure uses the expected waitlist events calculated from a Cox model, which is adjusted for age, patient comorbidities, and other risk factors at the time of dialysis.

The number of incident (newly initiated on dialysis) patients in a practitioner (inclusive of physicians and advanced practice providers) group who are under the age of 75 and were listed on the kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant waitlist or received a living donor transplant within the first year of initiating dialysis. The measure is calculated to compare the observed number of waitlist events in a practitioner group to its expected number of waitlist events.
