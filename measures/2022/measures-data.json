Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way). Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient’s status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

Actions in this plan may include, but are not limited to, the following:•\tIncorporate trauma-informed training into new employee orientation •\tOffer annual refreshers and/or trainings for all staff •\tRecommend and supply TIC materials to third party partners, including care management companies and billing services•\tIdentify patients using a screening methodology•\tFlag charts for patients with one or more adverse events that might have caused trauma•\tUse ICD-10 diagnosis codes for adverse events when appropriateTIC is a strengths-based healthcare delivery approach that emphasizes physical, psychological, and emotional safety for both trauma survivors and their providers. Core components of a TIC approach are: awareness of the prevalence of trauma; understanding of the impact of past trauma on services utilization and engagement; and a commitment and plan to incorporate that understanding into training, policy, procedure, and practice.",
