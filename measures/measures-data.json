This includes the provision of all necessary information to the patient that will allow the patient to enroll in an outpatient CR program. This also includes a written or electronic communication between the healthcare provider or healthcare system and the cardiac rehabilitation program that includes the patient's enrollment information for the program. A hospital discharge summary or office note may potentially be formatted to include the necessary patient information to communicate to the CR program (the patient’s cardiovascular history, testing, and treatments, for instance). According to standards of practice for cardiac rehabilitation programs, care coordination communications are sent to the referring provider, including any issues regarding treatment changes, adverse treatment responses, or new non-emergency condition (new symptoms, patient care questions, etc.) that need attention by the referring provider. These communications also include a progress report once the patient has completed the program. All communications must maintain an appropriate level of confidentiality as outlined by the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Note: A patient with a qualifying diagnosis should have a referral to CR within the subsequent 12 months. In the event that the patient has a second (recurrent) qualifying event before the original 12 month “referral” period has ended, a new 12 month “referral” period for CR referral starts at the time of the second qualifying event, since the patient again becomes eligible for CR at that time.",
