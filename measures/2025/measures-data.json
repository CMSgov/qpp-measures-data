Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way). Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient’s status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

    "description": "The measure calculates the percentage of a physician’s patients who have a continuity index of at least 0.7 (excluding patients with < 2 primary care visits during the measurement period). This is a physician-level measure for use in evaluating physician behavior; it leverages a previously validated continuity index that quantifies the extent to which patients experience continuity of provider in their primary care visits.\r\n\r\nThis measure evaluates the extent to which primary care physicians (PCPs) are supporting the continuity of care of their patients. High care continuity is shown to improve patient outcomes and physician well-being, is associated with decreased health care costs (total, ED, inpatient, primary care, and costs for specific conditions or treatments) and health care utilization (ED visits and hospitalizations). As a byproduct of building a trusting relationship over time, issues of equity and social risk can be addressed. Physicians who perform better are likely to have specific structures and processes in place that are conducive to allowing patients to achieve higher care continuity. \r\n\r\nCompared to lower scores (e.g., 0.6 or lower), continuity index scores of 0.7 or higher have been associated with significantly lower Medicare expenditures and significantly lower odds of hospitalization.1 \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n1. Higher Primary Care Physician Continuity is Associated with Lower Costs and Hospitalizations. Bazemore et al. Annals of Family Medicine. 2018. 16, 492-497.",
