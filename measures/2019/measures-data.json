Platforms and devices that collect patient-generated health data (PGHD) must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient, including patient reported outcomes (PROs). Examples include patient engagement and outcomes tracking platforms, cellular or web-enabled bi-directional systems, and other devices that transmit clinically valid objective and subjective data back to care teams. Because many consumer-grade devices capture PGHD (for example, wellness devices), platforms or devices eligible for this improvement activity must be, at a minimum, endorsed and offered clinically by care teams to patients to automatically send ongoing guidance (one way).  Platforms and devices that additionally collect PGHD must do so with an active feedback loop, either providing PGHD in real or near-real time to the care team, or generating clinically endorsed real or near-real time automated feedback to the patient (e.g. automated patient-facing instructions based on glucometer readings). Therefore, unlike passive platforms or devices that may collect but do not transmit PGHD in real or near-real time to clinical care teams, active devices and platforms can inform the patient or the clinical care team in a timely manner of important parameters regarding a patient's status, adherence, comprehension, and indicators of clinical concern.",

    "description": "The Screening/Surveillance Colonoscopy cost measure is meant to apply to clinicians who perform screening/surveillance colonoscopy procedures for Medicare beneficiaries during the performance period. Screening and surveillance colonoscopies are preventative care procedures that are meant to detect the presence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among patients who are at average risk or high risk of CRC, respectively. The measure evaluates a clinician’s risk-adjusted cost for the episode group by averaging it across all episodes attributed to the clinician. The cost of each episode is the sum of the cost to Medicare for services performed by the attributed clinician and other health care providers over the length of the episode, or “episode window.” The cost measure is calculated by determining the risk-adjusted episode cost,  averaged across all of a clinician’s episodes during the performance period.",
