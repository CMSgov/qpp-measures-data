# Note: 
# For 2019, benchmarks are generated by a master benchmark.csv in staging/.
# This csv is used to generate a the benchmarks JSON. 
# Merging is no longer supported.

# For 2019, the first historical benchmarks are generated by calculate-deciles-lib.js in
# the qpp-submissions-api repo, then the result is exported to the /benchmarks
# directory in this repo. Subsequent updated benchmarks for 2019 will
# be generated by this build:benchmarks script.

# Updates to 2017-2018 benchmarks are not supported. 
# If you wish to update benchmarks for 2017-2018, please revert commit history to before this
# comment was made by using git-annotate. 
# The old flow to generate benchmarks:
# input.csv => node scripts/parse-benchmarks-data.js => output.json
# staging/${YEAR}/benchmarks/json/output.json => npm run build:benchmarks => benchmarks/${YEAR}.json
