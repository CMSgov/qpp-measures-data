For patients with such conditions affecting the leg, foot, groin, or lower trunk regions, the change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Lower Quadrant Edema (LQE) FS PROM. For patients with such conditions affecting the arm, hand, chest, or breast body regions, the change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Upper Quadrant Edema (UQE) FS PROM. PROM scores were scaled to the 0-100 metric, with higher scores representing higher perceived functional status. In order to fairly measure performance between providers, the measure is risk-adjusted to patient characteristics known to be associated with FS outcomes and used as a performance measure at the patient and provider levels to assess quality.",,,,,,,,singlePerformanceRate,,,,,
QCDR,Functional Status Change in Dizziness,,,,FOTO6,,,"This is a patient-reported outcome performance measure (PRO-PM) consisting of a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) of risk-adjusted functional status (FS) change for patients aged 14 years and older with vestibular and other dizziness-related impairments. The change in FS is assessed using the FOTO Dizziness Positional Status (DPS) or Dizziness Functional Status (DFS) PROM; these are item-response theory-based PROMs developed using items from the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), scored using the T-score metric (mean=50, SD=10), with higher scores representing better FS. 

The DPS and DFS measure separate domains represented within DHI items.  The DPS score will be applied to this quality measure for patients with a statistically derived DPS cut-score (T-score) of 55 or lower whereas the DFS score will be applied for patients with a DPS T-score of greater than 55 at initial evaluation.  This approach is consistent with clinical and research observations that two types of vestibular impairments, positional- and functional-dominant, may have distinctly different clinical presentations and expected outcomes.  

Using a single PROM score derived from all 25 DHI items is not recommended due to score validity weaknesses; robust analyses using extensive exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses based on over 28,000 episodes of care determined the DHI items represent multiple domains, thus using a single overall score would pose a threat to validity. However, patient responses to DHI items may be used to directly score the DPS and DFS, allowing clinicians greater flexibility of choice of PROM used in routine clinical care without adding to clinician nor patient burden.

To fairly measure performance between providers, this quality measure is risk-adjusted to patient characteristics known to be associated with FS outcomes and used as a performance measure at the patient and provider levels to assess quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

QCDR,,,,,ABFM12,,,"This is a measure evaluating primary care physicians (PCPs); for each PCP, the denominator is all patients seen during the evaluation period who had at least 2 PCP visits. The numerator is the number of those patients whose Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index is >= 0.7. The Bice-Boxerman index is a validated measure of patient-level care continuity that ranges from 0 to 1; 0 reflects completely disjointed care and 1 reflects complete continuity with the same PCP for all visits. The Bice-Boxerman index was used in a previously NQF endorsed measure for children with medical complexity. Compared to lower scores (e.g., 0.6 or lower), continuity index scores of 0.7 or higher have been associated with significantly lower Medicare expenditures and significantly lower odds of hospitalization.1
